Minimization of the total energy consumption for a set of
industrial robots can be posed as a Mixed Integer Nonlinear
Program (MINLP). A nonlinear cost function describes the energy
use while a set of mixed integer linear constraints encode mutual
exclusion and preconditions.  Much of the problem structure is
lost when the mutual exclusions are converted into an integer
formulation.  We propose integrating MINLP and Constraint
Programming (CP) techniques to solve the nonlinear scheduling
problem more efficiently. By utilizing CP, infeasibilities caused
by the scheduling dynamics may be detected at an earlier stage in
the branch and bound tree. Linear and nonlinear programming
methods are added to Gecode using a custom constraint. Results
from a small case study on a job shop like problem with cubic
costs shows some promising results.
