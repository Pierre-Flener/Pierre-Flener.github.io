Many constraint satisfaction problems have some symmetry:  any 
assignment can be transformed into a set of symmetrically equivalent 
assignments. The symmetries preserve solutions:  if any assignment in a 
symmetry equivalent class is consistent with the constraints, they all 
are.  For instance, in many CSPs some of the variables refer to 
entities which are indistinguishable,  and the values assigned to these 
variables can be interchanged in any solution.  Where symmetry exists 
in a CSP, dealing with it effectively is often critical to the success 
of solving the CSP.  Unless this is done, search often thrashes, 
revisiting symmetrically equivalent states over and over again.

<p align=justify>
The SymCon'03 workshop will provide a forum for research into any aspect of 
symmetry in constraint satisfaction problems, including: 

<ul>
<li> symmetry detection 
<li> exploitation of symmetry e.g.  heuristics which use symmetry   
information
<li> elimination of symmetry e.g. remodelling the problem to reduce 
symmetry 
<li> avoidance of symmetry e.g. algorithms which avoid considering 
assignments symmetric to any assignment already considered
<li> exploitation of mathematical techniques such as group theory for 
dealing with symmetry in CSPs
<li> applications of constraint programming to problems with symmetry.
</ul>


<p align=justify>
SymCon'03 will be the third workshop in the series, following the successful earlier workshops
<a href="http://www.it.uu.se/research/group/astra/SymCon01/">SymCon'01</a>
at CP 2001 in Paphos, Cyprus and <a href="http://www.it.uu.se/research/group/astra/SymCon02/">SymCon'02</a> at CP
2002 in Ithaca, NY, USA.
It will be a  half-day workshop: SymCon'03 and the
<a href="http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/~frisch/Reformulation/03">Modelling & Reformulation Workshop</a> will be timetabled consecutively
to allow attendance at both. 

<p align=justify> 

<b>Steve Linton</b> (University of St Andrews) will give an invited talk at 
the Workshop.  Steve leads the international consortium developing GAP 
(Groups, Algorithms, Programs), a system used in particular for 
computational group theory.  He will talk on the links between group 
theory, symmetry and constraint programming.

<h2>Submission Process</h2>

Researchers wishing to give talks at the workshop should submit a paper in 
LNCS format by 23 July. Papers should normally be up to 8 pages, 
but longer papers (up to a maximum of 15 pages) may be submitted with the 
agreement of the programme chairs.  
Short papers, for instance describing work in progress, are acceptable. If
necessary for time reasons, only a subset of the papers will
be presented: a selection will then be made by the
Programme Committee.   However, all accepted papers will appear in the 
Workshop Notes. 

<p align=justify> Submitted  papers  should be emailed 
as PS or PDF files, to the Programme Chairs 
by Wednesday 23 July 2003.

<p align=justify>

At least one author of each presented submission
must attend the workshop.  
All workshop attendees must pay the CP 2003
workshop registration fee; attendance is otherwise open.
