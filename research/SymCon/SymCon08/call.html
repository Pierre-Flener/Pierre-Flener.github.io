              <strong>Workshop Description</strong></p>
          <p style="text-align: justify">
              &nbsp;&nbsp; SymCon'08 is the 8th in a series of workshops affiliated with the CP
              conference, and focuses on the investigation of symmetry and symmetry breaking techniques
              for Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs). Symmetries occur frequently in CSPs.
              When undetected, they cause thrashing during traditional backtracking search by
              redundantly exploring symmetric parts of the search space. The topic was discussed
              as far back as 1874 by Glaisher, and new techniques to detect and/or break symmetry
              have been proposed in recent years. However, many outstanding problems remain. For
              instance, the detection and exploitation of local, dynamic, and weak forms of symmetry
              remains a challenge.</p>
          <p style="text-align: justify">
              &nbsp;&nbsp; The workshop is a forum for researchers to present advances in symmetry
              breaking techniques and to discuss the above or other open problems. Additionally,
              the workshop welcomes the presentation of applications and case studies that exhibit
              some form of symmetry. The workshop is relevant to the computational group theory
              (CGT) community because CGT is often the theory underlying many symmetry breaking
              techniques. Importantly, the organizers welcome submissions from researchers working
              in other areas of Artificial Intelligence who feel that their work would be of interest
              to the CP community. Such areas include planning, model checking, QBF formulas,
              finite model search, and theorem proving in FOL.</p>
          <p style="text-align: justify">
              &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Workshop topics include, but are not limited to:<br />
              - Symmetry definition: semantic symmetry, syntactic symmetry, constraint symmetry,
              solution symmetry<br />
              - Automatic symmetry detection: static approaches and dynamic approaches<br />
              - Global symmetry detection and elimination<br />
              - Dynamic symmetry detection and elimination<br />
              - Combining symmetry breaking techniques<br />
              - Exploiting weak forms of symmetries like "dominance" and "almost-symmetries"<br />
              - Case studies of problems that exhibit interesting symmetries<br />
              - Application of computational group theory techniques to symmetry breaking
              <br />
              - Heuristics that use information about symmetry to guide search - Elimination and
              avoidance of symmetry by re-modelling<br />
              - Dynamic avoidance of symmetric states during search<br />
              - Complexity analysis of symmetry breaking techniques<br />
              - Application of CSPs to symmetry and related algebraic problems - Comparing symmetry
              breaking techniques in constraint programming with techniques for dealing with symmetry
              in other search domains
              <br />
              - Symmetry in CNF formulas and OBF formulas<br />
              - Symmetry in finite model search in first order logic
              <br />
              - Novel exploitation of symmetry in varied search domains of interest to the CP
              community</p>

          <p style="text-align: justify">
              &nbsp;&nbsp; The workshop is open to all members of the CP community. At least one
              author of each submission accepted for presentation must attend the workshop and
              present the contribution. All workshop attendees must pay the workshop fee.</p>
          <p style="text-align: center">
              <strong>Paper Submission</strong></p>
          <p style="text-align: justify">
              To submit a paper to the workshop, please e-mail a PS or PDF file in IJCAI03 style
              to <a href="mailto:email">email</a>.<br />
              <br />
              Papers must be formatted using <a href="http://www.cmi.univ-mrs.fr/~benhamou/symcon07/ijcai.sty">IJCAI</a> requirements and can be of any length not exceeding
              8 pages. All submissions must be received by June 22nd, 2008. The Program Committee
              Chairs will acknowledge all submissions. If a submitted paper is not acknowledged
              in 2 working days, the authors are kindly requested to contact one of the chairs.</p>
          <p style="text-align: center">
              <strong>Selection Process</strong></p>

              All submissions will be reviewed. Those that present a significant contribution
              to the workshop topics will be accepted for publication in the workshop proceedings.
              The proceedings will be available electronically at the workshop web-page and in
              hardcopy at CP 2008.
          </p>
          <p>
              If necessary, for time reasons, only a subset of the papers will be presented. A
              selection will then be made by the Program Committee Chairs.
