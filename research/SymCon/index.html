A symmetry is a transformation of an entity that preserves its
properties.  The transformed entity is thus identical to and
indistinguishable from the original one.  For instance, rotating a
chess board 180 degrees gives us a board that is indistinguishable
from the original one. </p>

<p>Many constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) have symmetries in the
variables, domains, or constraints, or any combination thereof.  Each
of these symmetries preserves satisfiability, so that when there is
symmetry in a CSP, any assignment can be transformed into an
equivalent one without affecting whether or not it satisfies the
constraints. </p>

<p>Symmetry can have an enormous effect on the combinatorial
complexity of CSPs.  In the presence of symmetry, a constraint solver
may waste an exorbitant amount of time considering symmetric but
equivalent assignments or partial assignments.  Hence, dealing with
symmetry is often crucial to the success of solving such CSPs
efficiently. </p>

<p>The development of symmetry breaking and symmetry detection
techniques in constraint programming (CP) has actually started in the
early 1990s.  In the early 2000s, there was a renewed and intense
interest in such techniques.  Progress made especially during these
last few years is substantial, whereby the SymCon workshop series has
played a key role in providing an open forum for CSP researchers as
well as researchers from SAT, Mathematical Programming, and
Computational Group Theory alike. </p>
