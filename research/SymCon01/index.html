SymCon'01 -- Symmetry in Constraint Satisfaction Problems
</h1></center>

<p align=justify>
There are many constraint satisfaction problems that have a great deal of
symmetry.  This symmetry can be used to increase the efficiency of search
by avoiding exploring paths that have already been shown to be a dead-end
in a symmetrical part of the search tree, or by only enumerating one
solution per equivalence class.  This process is often referred to as
symmetry breaking or symmetry exclusion.  For example, when colouring
a graph, many of the
solutions are related simply by rotating the colours.  Or, for example,
when solving a tournament timetabling problem, at the start it does not
matter in which order the participants play the first games.  This workshop
is to focus on the analysis and development of techniques to detect and
exploit symmetry in constraint satisfaction problems.

<p align=justify>
This will be a half-day workshop, with open attendance.  People wishing to
give a talk should submit a 4-to-8-page extended abstract, in article or
LNCS style.  If necessary for time reasons, only a subset of the submitted
works will be able to be presented: a selection will then be made by the
Programme Committee.  Also, informal proceedings will be assembled from
selected abstracts and all statements of interest.  Work-in-progress may
thus be submitted, and material from other submissions may thus be reused.

<p align=justify>
This workshop will be relevant to people who are interested either in
increasing the efficiency of search or in understanding the structure
of constraint satisfaction problems.  So far, different techniques for
symmetry breaking have been studied: those acting on the model, as well as
techniques that alter the search procedure (by altering the branching
strategy or dynamically removing symmetries). This purpose of this
workshop is to bring together people  interested in this fast
growing area.
