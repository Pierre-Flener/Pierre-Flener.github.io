<h1>Special Issue on Constraint Programming <br/>
  for Air Traffic Control & Management</h1>

<h2>at <a href="http://journals.cambridge.org/jid_KER">The Knowledge Engineering Review</a></h2>

<hr/>

<h4>Constraint Programming</h4>

<p>Constraint Programming (CP) is a powerful technology to model and
solve combinatorial (optimisation) problems, which are ubiquitous in
industry.  CP works either via systematic search based on constraint
propagation (the elimination of impossible values), or via
constraint-based local search.  CP is an ideal integration technology
for hybrid solving, including also methods from classical operations
research, such as mixed integer programming, and Boolean
satisfiability.  CP is now a mature field and has been successfully
used for tackling a wide range of real-life complex applications,
especially for short-term scheduling, personnel rostering, and
configuration problems.</p>

<h4>Aims & Scope of the Special Issue</h4>

<!--
<p>The aim of this special issue is to collect original papers on
applying constraint programming within the areas of air traffic
control (ATC) and air traffic management (ATM).</p>

<p>Special issue topics include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>airspace sectorisation</li>
  <li>arrival management</li>
  <li>complexity resolution</li>
  <li>departure management</li>
  <li>flow management</li>
  <li>route network design</li>
  <li>runway allocation</li>
  <li>slot allocation</li>
</ul>
-->

<p>This special issue is a follow-up to the <a
 href="http://www.it.uu.se/research/group/astra/ATM-CT/">International
Workshop on Constraint Programming for Air Traffic Control &
Management</a>, held at the <a
 href="http://ino2009eurocontrol.fr/Previous/index-48108.php">7th
EuroControl Innovative Research Workshop & Exhibition</a> at the <a
 href="http://www.eurocontrol.int/eec/">EuroControl Experimental
Centre</a> in Brétigny-sur-Orge, France on Tuesday 2 December 2008,
and where the proceedings consisted only of the slides of the
presentations given.  The call for papers was not restricted to the
participants of that workshop.</p>

<p>Note that <a href="http://www.eurocontrol.int/">EuroControl</a> is
the <em>European Organisation for the Safety of Air Navigation</em>,
with 38 member states at present and headquarters in Brussels,
Belgium.</p>

<h4>Submission Process</h4>

<p>Papers must present original work that has not been formally
published before.  Papers that expand conference papers with at least
30% extra material are acceptable, together with an indication of
where that initial version was formally published.  We prefer shorter
papers to longer ones, for the sake of greater diversity and more
thorough reviewing.  Authors are therefore encouraged to be as concise
as possible, as well as to limit their papers to 30 pages.</p>

<p>To aid planning and organisation, send us an email by 1 March 2009
with a statement of intent to submit a paper, including its author
information, a tentative title and abstract, and an estimated number
of pages.</p>

<p>To submit a paper, written in English, send us an email by 1 May
2009 with the actual title, abstract, authors' names, affiliations,
and email addresses, as well as (a URL of) a PDF version of the
paper.</p>

<p>All submitted papers will be thoroughly peer-reviewed according to
the standards of the usual <a
 href="http://journals.cambridge.org/jid_KER">Knowledge Engineering
Review (KER)</a> refereeing process, by at least two CP experts and
one ATC/ATM expert, where possible.  Authors of submitted papers may
be asked to review other submitted papers.  For information, KER
currently has an ISI JCR impact factor of 1.312.  The editors in chief
of KER reserve the right to make the final acceptance/rejection
decisions.</p>

<p>Accepted papers must be prepared using
the <a href="http://assets.cambridge.org/KER/KER_ifc.pdf">KER author
instructions</a>.</p>
