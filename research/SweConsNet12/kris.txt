In this talk we will present a CP-based method for application
scheduling, binding and data routing for a run-time
reconfigurable operator based multimedia architecture (ROMA). In
this approach, an abstract representation models memories,
reconfigurable operator cells, communication network and its
topology. The use of constraints programming makes it possible to
model the application scheduling, binding and data routing as
well as architectural and temporal constraints in a single
model. We have evaluated our approach on several multimedia
applications from the Mediabench set. In 78% of cases, our system
provides results that are proved optimal.
