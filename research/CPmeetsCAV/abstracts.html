<h4><a name="fages">On Solving Temporal Logic Constraints in Constrained Transition Systems</a></h4>
<p>Fran&ccedil;ois Fages</p>
<p>We study constrained transition systems where both states and
transitions are described symbolically with constraints, and consider
the satisfaction of temporal logic formulae containing free variables.
We present a fixpoint procedure to solve temporal logic constraints in
this setting and show its generality compared to the constraint-based
deductive model-checking method of Delzanno and Podelski.  We
illustrate the expressive power of this framework with a few examples,
describe its implementation in Prolog and PPL, and demonstrate the
scalability of this approach with one challenging application for the
parameter synthesis problem of piecewise multi-affine models of gene
regulation.</p>

<div><h4><a name="senni">Program Transformation and Constraint-Based Verification</a></h4>
<p>Valerio Senni</p>

<p>
We illustrate a framework for rewriting Constraint Logic Programs (CLP),
based on Program Transformation (PT).
CLP has been used to provide a model of the behavior of a program, or a system,
as well as verification conditions. The interest of using a CLP-based language
for this task is in its expressiveness, obtained combining a language
of constraints
on a specific domain (e.g., FD, trees, reals, integers) with
recursion, unification, and negation.
PT is a rule-based rewriting calculus that is traditionally used to achieve
optimizations of a given program, guided by syntactic properties of
the given program.
We show how some optimization strategies can be used to perform (or
simply improve)
some analysis tasks. The transformation process, integrated with
constraint manipulation
techniques, is successful whenever it is able to reduce the initial,
complex reasoning
task to a much easier one (such as a simple constraint satisfiability test).</p>

<div><h4><a name="bardin">An Alternative to SAT-based Approaches for Bit-Vectors</a></h4>

<p>S&eacute;bastien Bardin
</p>


<p>
The theory BV of bit-vectors, i.e. fixed-size arrays of bits equipped
with standard low-level machine instructions, is becoming very popular
in formal verification.  Standard solvers for this theory are based on
a bit-level encoding into propositional logic and SAT-based resolution
techniques.  In this paper, we investigate an alternative approach
based on a word-level encoding into bounded arithmetic and Constraint
Programming (CP) resolution techniques.  We define an original CP
framework (domains and propagators) dedicated to bitvector
constraints.  This framework is implemented in a prototype and thorough
experimental studies have been conducted.  The new approach is shown to
perform much better than standard CP-based approaches, and to
considerably reduce the gap with the best SAT-based BV solvers.
</p>

<p>
(Remark: the interest here regarding "CP meets CAV" is to show how
CP(FD) can be used as a promising alternative to the standard
SAT-based resolution of bitvectors constraints, which are a major
issue in program verification.)

<div><h4><a name="bardin-2">A Combined Approach for Solving Constraints over Finite Domains and Arrays</a></h4>

<p>S&eacute;bastien Bardin
</p>
  

<p>
Arrays are ubiquitous in the context of software verification.
However, effective reasoning over arrays is still rare in CP, as local
reasoning is dramatically ill-conditioned for constraints over arrays.
In this paper, we propose an approach combining both global symbolic
reasoning and local filtering in order to solve constraint systems
involving arrays (with accesses, updates and size constraints) and
finite-domain constraints over their elements and indexes. Our
approach, named fdcc, is based on a combination of a congruence
closure algorithm for the standard theory of arrays and a CP solver
over finite domains.  The tricky part of the work lies in the
bi-directional communication mechanism between both solvers.  We
identify the significant information to share, and design ways to
master the communication overhead.  Experiments on random instances
show that fdcc solves more formulas than any portfolio combination of
the two solvers taken in isolation, while overhead is kept reasonable.
</p>

<p>
(Remark: The interest here regarding "CP meets CAV" is the following.
First note that the theory of arrays is crucial in software
verification.  We show how to combine symbolic techniques (typically
used in CAV) and filtering techniques from CP to solve constraints
over arrays ranging over finite domains.)

<div><h4><a name="tronci">Quantized Feedback Control Software Synthesis from System Level Formal
Specifications</a></h4>

<p>Enrico Tronci</p>

<p>
Many Embedded Systems are indeed Software Based Control Systems, that
is control systems whose controller consists of control software
running on a microcontroller device.  This motivates investigation on
Formal Model Based Design approaches for automatic synthesis of
embedded systems control software.
</p>

<p>
We present an algorithm, along with a tool QKS implementing it, that
from a formal model (as a Discrete Time Linear Hybrid System, DTLHS)
of the controlled system (plant), Implementation Specifications (that
is, number of bits in the Analog-to-Digital, AD, conversion) and
System Level Formal Specifications (that is, safety and liveness
requirements for the closed loop system) returns
correct-by-construction control software that has a Worst Case
Execution Time (WCET) linear in the number of AD bits and meets the
given specifications.
</p>

<p>
We model DTLHSs, as well as safety and liveness properties as boolean
combinations of linear constraints over real as well as discrete
variables. We use a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) solver
(namely, GLPK), to compute a suitable finite state overapproximation
of the DTLHS modelling the plant and use Ordered Binary Decision
Diagrams (OBDDs) to compute a (BLIF representation of a) controller
meeting the given specifications and then to generate a C
implementation for such a controller.
</p>

<p>
We show feasibility of our approach by presenting experimental results
on using it to synthesize control software for a buck DC-DC converter,
a widely used mixed-mode analog circuit.

<div><h4><a name="codish">Programming with Boolean Satisfaction</a></h4>

<p>Mike Codish</p>


<p>
In recent years, research on Boolean satisfiability (SAT) is
generating remarkably powerful SAT solvers capable of handling larger
and larger SAT instances.  With the availability of progressively
stronger SAT solvers, an accumulating number of applications have been
developed which demonstrate that real world problems can often be
solved by encoding them into SAT.  Tailgating the success of SAT
technology are a variety of tools which can be applied to help specify
and then compile problem instances to corresponding SAT instances.
Typically, a constraint based modeling language is introduced and used
to model instances. Then encoding techniques are applied to compile
constraints to the language of an underlying solver such as SAT, SMT,
or others.  In this talk I advocate the need for "optimizing
compilers" for SAT encoding and present BEE ("Ben-Gurion University
Equi-propagation Encoder").  Using BEE eases the encoding process and
performs optimizations to simplify constraints prior to their encoding
to CNF.  I will describe these optimizations: equi-propagation,
partial evaluation, and decomposition, and demonstrate their
application.

<div><h4><a name="ruemmer">Reasoning for Verification: Theorem Provers, SMT, and Interpolation</a></h4>

<p>Philipp R&uuml;mmer
</p>


<p>
Automated theorem provers and SMT solvers form the backbone of many of
today’s verification systems, responsible for discharging verification
conditions that encode correctness properties of hardware or software
designs, generating counterexamples, refining abstractions, and other
purposes.  In this talk I will try to give an overview of automated
logic-based reasoning technology relevant for verification; while the
selection will necessarily be biased by personal research, prejudice
will be kept at a minimum.  I will in particular outline successes, a
number of current research directions, including Craig interpolation,
and challenges in the development of solvers tailored to verification.

<div><h4><a name="enea">Abstract Domains for Automated Reasoning about List-Manipulating
Programs with Infinite Data</a></h4>

<p>Constantin Enea
</p>


<p>
We describe a framework for reasoning about programs with lists
carrying integer numerical data.  We use abstract domains to describe
and manipulate complex constraints on configurations of these programs
mixing constraints on the shape of the heap, sizes of the lists, on
the multisets of data stored in these lists, and on the data at their
different positions.  Moreover, we provide powerful techniques for
automatic validation of Hoare-triples and invariant checking, as well
as for automatic synthesis of invariants and procedure summaries using
modular inter-procedural analysis.  The approach has been implemented
in a tool called CELIA and experimented successfully on a large
benchmark of programs.

<div><h4><a name="yang">Abstractions from Tests</a></h4>

<p>Hongseok Yang
</p>


<p>
In this talk, I will present a framework for leveraging dynamic
analysis to find good abstractions for static analysis.  A static
analysis in our framework is parametrised.  Our main insight is to
directly and efficiently compute from a concrete trace, a necessary
condition on the parameter configurations to prove a given query, and
thereby prune the space of parameter configurations that the static
analysis must consider.  Following this framework, we have developed
two cost-effective static analyses: a flow- and context-sensitive
thread-escape analysis and a flow- and context-insensitive points-to
analysis. In the talk, I will use the former analysis as a running
example, and explain the key ideas of our framework concretely. I will
also comment on the results of running this analysis on six Java
programs comprising two million bytecodes.

<div><h4><a name="piskac-1">SMT Solvers and Their Limitations</a></h4>

<p>Ruzica Piskac
</p>

<p>
Modern SMT solvers are powerful tools, used as a core engine in
applications, such as program analysis, software engineering, program 
model checking, hardware verification, and many more.  In this talk we
give an overview of basic techniques,  used in the implementation of SMT
solvers. SMT solvers can reason about formulas that combine several
different theories and we describe the standard Nelson-Oppen combination
procedure. We also report on some of the limitations of today's SMT
solvers. Although the research and development of theory solvers is guided
by need of the users, there are still some interesting decidable theories
that lack an efficient theory solver. In addition,  not all SMT solvers
can handle quantified formulas. There exist complete instantiation-based
procedures that can address the satisfiability question, even for
quantified formulas. Finally, we will show that the requirements of
Nelson-Oppen combination are too restrictive and we will presented a new
combination technique for theories sharing sets. This combination
procedure works by reduction to a common shared theory. The resulting
theory is useful for automated verification of complex properties of data
structure implementations.

<div><h4><a name="piskac-2">Software Synthesis using Automated Reasoning</a></h4>

<p>Ruzica Piskac</p>

<p>
Software synthesis is a technique for automatically generating code from
a given specification. The goal of software synthesis is to make
software development easier, while increasing both the productivity of
the programmer and the correctness of the produced code.  In this talk, we
present an approach to synthesis that relies on the use of automated
reasoning and decision procedures. Comfusy is an extension to the Scala
compiler and a tool for complete functional synthesis. It accepts as an
input expressions with input and output variables  and outputs code that
computes output values as a function of input values. In addition, it also
outputs the preconditions that the input variables have to satisfy in
order for a solution to exist. We will also present a tool for interactive
synthesis of code snippets.
