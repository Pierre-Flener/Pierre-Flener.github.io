We discuss the consistency of constraints for which the set of
solutions can be recognised by an automaton. Such an automaton
induces a decomposition of the constraint into a conjunction of
constraints. The so far most general result is that if the
constraint hypergraph of such a decomposition is Berge-acyclic,
then the decomposition provides hyper-arc consistency. We focus
on constraint networks that have alpha-acyclic or centred-cyclic
hypergraph representations and give conditions where the induced
decomposition provides hyper-arc consistency. We also give
conditions that help derive implied constraints that are
necessary to maintain hyper-arc consistency.
