<h2>About the Workshop</h2>

<p>
<a href="http://www.it.uu.se/SweConsNet/">SweConsNet</a> is the Network
for Sweden-based researchers and practitioners of Constraint
technology.
</p>

<p>
Following the previous successful workshops, we would like to
announce the 11th SweConsNet workshop, which will take place in
Örebro, Sweden on May 14th 2012. The workshop is organized in
collocation with the <a href="http://www.sais.se/sais2012/">27th
annual workshop</a> of the <a href="http://www.sais.se/">Swedish
Artificial Intelligence Society (SAIS)</a>.
</p>

<p>
The purpose of this workshop is to learn about ongoing research
in constraint programming, as well as existing projects and
products.  We will also discuss the further development of the
network, such as a possible widening to other Nordic
countries. 
</p>

<p>
The workshop is open to everybody interested in the theory and practice of constraint programming, whether based in Sweden or elsewhere.  The scope of the workshop spans all areas of Constraint Programming, and is open to presentations and discussions addressing topics related to both theory and application.
</p>

<p>
Please forward a link of this page to people who might be interested but
are not yet on the SweConsNet mailing list.  They can subscribe to it
by sending a message to Justin.Pearson at it.uu.se .
</p>

<p>
We hope for your participation, and highly encourage you to
submit a proposal for a presentation of your ongoing work, recent
results, or of a relevant discussion topic.  There are no paper
submissions, reviews, or proceedings, hence recent
conference/journal papers may also be presented.  
</p>

<p> 
To register, please send a brief statement of intent, and
desirably the title and abstract of your talk, to Christian
Schulte (cschulte at kth.se).  In order to facilitate
organization, please notify us of your intention to participate
as soon as possible, and at the latest before April 30th,
2012. The workshop does not have a registration fee.  
</p>
