Tail Assignment is the problem of assigning flight legs to
aircraft while satisfying all operational constraints. We propose
a hybrid column generation and constraint programming solution
approach, which is able to quickly produce solutions for
operations management, as well as close-to-optimal solutions for
long and mid term planning. Computational results using
real-world Tail Assignmen instances are presented.
