<h2>About the Workshop</h2>

<p>
<a href="http://www.it.uu.se/SweConsNet/">SweConsNet</a> is the Network
for Sweden-based researchers and practitioners of Constraint
technology.
</p>

<p>
Following the previous successful workshops, we would like to
announce the 5th SweConsNet workshop, which will take place at
the Department of Electronics, Computer, and Software Systems,
School of Information and Communication Technology, KTH - Royal
Institute of Technology, Kista on March 15th.  
</p>

<p>
The purpose of this workshop is to learn about ongoing research
in constraint programming, as well as existing projects and
products.  We will also discuss the further development of the
network, such as a possible widening to other Nordic
countries. 
</p>

<p>
The workshop is open to everybody interested in the theory and
practice of constraint programming, whether based in Sweden or
not.
</p>

<p>
Please forward this message to people who might be interested but
not yet on the SweConsNet mailing list.  They can subscribe to it
by sending a message to Justin.Pearson at it.uu.se .
</p>

<p>
We hope for your participation, if not a presentation of your
ongoing work/recent results or proposal for discussion.  For
better planning, we need your preliminary confirmation, and if
possible the title of your talk.  Please send it as soon as
possible to me as the organizer (<a href="mailto:schulte@imit.kth.se">Christian Schulte</a>). If you plan on attending without making a
presentation, send me an email with the number (and names) of
people from your group that intend to come.
</p>

<h2>Location Information</h2>

<p>
The wokshop will take place at the Forum building in Kista, 8th floor, elevator C (make sure that you take elevator C!). At the door there you need to give me a call to enter, either use 4264 at the doorphone or get me on my mobile (see <a href="/~schulte/contact.php">here</a>). More information on how to get to Forum is available <a href="http://www.ict.kth.se/artikel/1078/070/se">here</a>.
