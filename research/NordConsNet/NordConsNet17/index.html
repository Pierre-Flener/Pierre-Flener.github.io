<h2> Submit a Presentation Proposal (closed)</h2>

<p>We hope for your participation, and highly encourage you to submit
a proposal for a presentation of your ongoing work, recent results, or
of a relevant discussion topic. There are no paper submissions,
reviews, or proceedings, hence recent conference/journal papers may
also be presented. Please contact Mats Carlsson if you would like to
present.</p>

<h2> Presentation Abstracts</h2>

<h3> sunny-cp: A Multicore Tool for Constraint Solving</h3>

<p>Jacopo Mauro (University of Oslo): In Constraint Programming (CP),
a portfolio solver uses a variety of different solvers for solving a
given Constraint Satisfaction / Optimisation Problem. We introduce
sunny-cp2: the first parallel CP portfolio solver that enables a
dynamic, cooperative, and simultaneous execution of its solvers in a
multicore setting. It incorporates state-of-the-art solvers, providing
also a usable and configurable framework. Empirical results are very
promising. sunny-cp2 can even outperform the performance of the oracle
solver which always selects the best solver of the portfolio for a
given problem.</p>

<h3> Optimal Scheduling in Wireless Networks: Modelling, Solution
via Integer Programming, and Recent Developments</h3>

<p>Di Yuan (Uppsala University): Optimal scheduling is a fundamental
aspect of resource sharing in wireless networks. In general, the
problem consists in determining which communication links shall
concurrently transmit and for how long, so as to optimise some
performance metric. Concurrent transmissions generate interference to
each other, giving rise to the main constraint in the optimisation
problem. In this presentation, we will review the minimum-time
scheduling problem in wireless networks. Specifically, we will
highlight the importance of mathematical modelling for problem
solving, and present solution methods for scheduling and its
sub-problem by means of integer linear programming. Next, we will
discuss some recent developments, with focus on extensions to
scheduling with rate regions and deadline constraints. Insights from
studying the extensions, in fact, generalise to optimal scheduling for
serving processes in any system, where the serving rate of one process
(i.e., the amount of demand completed per time unit) monotonically
decreases as more processes are jointly served – a condition that
holds in virtual all applications in which processes compete with each
other in resource sharing.</p>

<h3> Auto-Tabling for Subproblem Presolving in MiniZinc</h3>

<p>Jip Dekker (Uppsala University): A well-known and powerful
constraint model reformulation is to compute the solutions to a model
part, say a custom constraint predicate, and tabulate them within an
extensional constraint that replaces that model part. Despite the
possibility of achieving higher solving performance, this tabling
reformulation is often not tried, because it is tedious to perform;
further, if successful, it obfuscates the original model. In order to
encourage modellers to try tabling, we extend the MiniZinc toolchain
to perform the automatic tabling of suitably annotated predicate
definitions, without requiring any changes to solvers, thereby
eliminating both the tedium and the obfuscation.</p>

<h3> Context Aware Reconfiguration in Software Product Lines</h3>

<p>Jacopo Mauro (University of Oslo, Norway): Software Product Lines
(SPLs) are a mechanism to capture families of closely related software
systems by modelling commonalities and variability. Although user
customisation has a growing importance in software systems and is a
vital sales argument, SPLs currently only allow user customisation at
deploy-time. We extend the notion of context-aware SPLs by means of
user profiles, containing a linearly ordered set of preferences. We
present a reconfiguration engine checking the validity of the current
configuration and, if necessary, reconfiguring the SPL while trying to
fulfil the preferences of the active user profile.</p>

<h3> VRP for Smart Municipal Solid-Waste Management</h3>

<p>Leslie Sheng: Sircle provides a real time data for solid waste bins
fill-levels and local traffic conditions. Sircle can quantify and
monitor solid waste bin fill levels ultrasonically to alert solid
waste collection trucks when the bin needs to be emptied.  Optimised
collection routes are then identified by Sircle, which diverts solid
waste collection fleets away from traffic jams and smaller roads and
identifies the best routes to take. This improves the efficiency of
the collection of municipal solid waste (MSW) and reduces operational
costs.</p>

<h3> Hybrid Constraint-Based Planning for Autonomous Industrial Vehicles</h3>

<p>Masoumeh Mansouri (Örebro University): Fleet automation often
involves solving several sub-problems, including task allocation,
motion planning, and coordination. The sub-problems are also strongly
correlated, meaning that each imposes additional constraints on other
subproblems. We propose to cast the problem of autonomous fleet
management to a meta-CSP, that is, a CSP whose constraints capture the
dependencies between the sub-problems in the fleet automation
application. We instantiate the approach in several industrial fleet
management applications, including a drill pattern planning problem in
open-pit mining studied in cooperation with Atlas Copco.</p>

<h3> Protein modelling using dynamic programming and constraints</h3>

<p>Maryana Wånggren (Chalmers): Molecular dynamics simulations, often
combined with simulated annealing, are commonly used when calculating
structural models of proteins, e.g. based on NMR experiments. However,
one is often faced with limited and sometimes insufficient information
for determining a well-resolved 3D structure. In addition, the type of
data available for different proteins may vary: ranges for torsion
angles, distance approximations, relative orientation of different
molecular parts etc. We are using whatever structural information is
around, together with a dynamic programming approach for searching the
space of feasible conformations to rapidly determine 3D structures
that are consistent with the input constraints.  We are currently
investigating how sets of constraints can be used to focus the
computational effort on the most important parts of the search space
in order to improve runtime performance and memory usage.</p>

<h3> Discrete Optimisation in Image Processing</h3>

<p>Robin Strand (Uppsala University): With the fast development of
imaging hardware and the explosion of image data being collected,
image processing is today used in most people’s everyday life, and it
has applications in many research areas, including digital humanities,
material science, medicine, biology and biomedicine.  Two of the most
important, and difficult, image processing problems are image
segmentation, where the goal is to partition a given image into object
and background components, and registration, where the goal is to
align a target image with a reference image.  Many different image
segmentation and registration methods are available, spanning from
fully automatic to fully interactive (guided by a user), where some
are model-based and some operate directly on image intensities. A
common thread among these methods is the need for reliable
optimisation methods. Since the digital image data being processed is
inherently discrete, discrete and combinatorial optimisation is
well-suited for the task of finding optimal image segmentation and
registration results.  In this talk, I will present some challenging,
and hopefully interesting, problems within image processing with
examples from ongoing research at the Department of Information
Technology and at the Radiology Division at the Akademiska hospital,
including image segmentation and registration.</p>

<h3> Handling Combinatorial Aspects of Time-Series Constraints Based
on Regular-Expression Characteristics</h3>

<p>Nicolas Beldiceanu (IMT Atlantique, France): After presenting an
overview of our work on time-series constraints in the context of CP
and LP, the presentation focusses on the introduction of the concept
of regular expression characteristics as a unified way to express
concisely combinatorial properties on time-series constraints. This
allows going from a compositional way of defining time-series
constraints to a compositional way to deal with their combinatorial
aspect without developing ad-hoc methods for each time-series
constraint separately.</p>
