Testing a telecommunication protocol often requires protocol log
analysis. A protocol log is a sequence of messages with
timestamps. Protocol log analysis involves checking that the content
of messages and timestamps are correct with respect to the protocol
specification. We talk about some recent work on using constraint
programming both  generation protocol logs to be used as test-cases
for telecommunication equipment, and the use of constraint programming
directly to verify the behaviour of telecommunication components.  
 Our case study is the Public Warning System service,
which is a part of the Long Term Evolution (LTE) 4G standard.
