   Previous approaches for scheduling a league with round-robin and
   divisional tournaments involved decomposing the problem into easier
   subproblems. This approach, used to schedule the top Swedish
   handball league Elitserien, reduces the problem complexity but can
   result in suboptimal schedules. This paper presents an integrated
   constraint programming model that allows to perform the scheduling
   in a single step. Particular attention is given to identifying
   implied and symmetry-breaking constraints that reduce the
   computational complexity significantly. The experimental evaluation
   of the integrated approach takes considerably less computational
   effort than the previous approach.
