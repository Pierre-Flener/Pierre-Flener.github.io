Automata, possibly with counters, allow many constraints to be
expressed in a simple and high-level way. An automaton induces a
decomposition into a conjunction of already implemented
constraints. Generalised arc consistency is not generally
maintained on decompositions induced by counter automata with
more than one state or counter. To improve propagation of
automaton-induced constraint decompositions, we use automated
tools to derive loop invariants from the constraint checker
corresponding to the given automaton. These loop invariants
correspond to implied constraints, which can be added to the
decomposition. We consider two global constraints and derive
implied constraints to improve propagation even to the point of
maintaining generalised arc consistency.
