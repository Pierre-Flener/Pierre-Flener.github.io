<h2 id="the-workshop">The Workshop</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://pierre-flener.github.io/research/NordConsNet">Nordic Network for researchers and practitioners of Constraint programming (NordConsNet, the network formerly known as SweConsNet)</a> invites you to participate in its next workshop.  The purpose is to share information about the research and practice of constraint programming (CP) in the Nordic countries.  This is the jubilee 20th edition of this almost annual workshop.</p>


<h2 id="organisation">Organisation</h2>

<p>The NordConsNet Workshop 2025 is chaired by <a href="https://pierre-flener.github.io">Pierre Flener</a> and <a href="https://justinkennethpearson.github.io">Justin Pearson</a>, both of the <a href="https://www.uu.se/en/department/information-technology/research/research-groups/optimisation-research-group">Optimisation research group</a> at Uppsala University, Sweden.  They founded this network <a href="https://pierre-flener.github.io/research/NordConsNet/SweConsNet02">as SweConsNet in 2002</a>, when they knew a bit less of HTML than now.</p>



<h2 id="date">Dates</h2>

<p>The workshop is held from lunch on Wednesday 20 August to lunch on
Thursday 21 August 2025.</p>


<h2 id="location">Location</h2>

<p>The workshop takes place at Uppsala University in <a href="https://link.mazemap.com/YzDaSKs6">lecture hall 101195 (Heinz-Otto Kreiss)</a> on floor 1 of house 10 at <a href="https://www.uu.se/en/campus/angstrom-laboratory/visit-us">Ångström Laboratory</a> on Regementsvägen 10 in Uppsala, Sweden.  The two lunches are in <a href="https://link.mazemap.com/KSJeXTU2">Restaurang Rullan</a> on floor 0 at the same address.  The venue is a pleasant thirty-minute walk from the central railway station, and we have ordered good weather.</p>


<h2 id="accommodation">Accommodation</h2>

<p>We hold 20 rooms for the workshop night at <a href="https://destinationuppsala.se/places/citystay-uppsala/">Best Western Hotel Uppsala</a> on Trädgårdsgatan 5A in the centre, for 1,395 SEK (including VAT): write to <a href="mailto:booking@bestwesternuppsala.se">booking@BestWesternUppsala.se</a> (or call +4618121000) and mention "NordConsNet Workshop 2025": first come, first served.</p>


<h2 id="submit-a-presentation-proposal-closed">Submit a Presentation Proposal</h2>

<p>We hope for your participation, and encourage you to submit a proposal for a presentation of your ongoing work, recent results, or a relevant discussion topic.  There are no abstract and paper submissions, no reviews, and no proceedings, hence recent conference or journal papers may also be presented.  Contact <a href="https://pierre-flener.github.io">Pierre Flener</a> if you would like to present something.</p>

<h2 id="registration">Registration</h2>

<p>Send an email to <a href="https://justinkennethpearson.github.io">Justin Pearson</a>.  Registration --- including 2 lunches and fika --- must be sent no later than xx August 2025 (to be announced).  If you register after that date, then you are still very welcome to attend talks (the lecture hall is large enough), but lunch cannot be guaranteed.  There is no registration fee for the workshop.</p>

<p>You may forward this information to anyone who has a legitimate interest in this workshop but is not yet on the NordConsNet mailing list: they can subscribe to it by applying to <a href="https://justinkennethpearson.github.io">Justin Pearson</a>.</p>

<h3 id="stuckey">RAIRE: A Branch and Bound Approach to Auditing Instant-Runoff Voting Elections</h3>
<p><strong>Peter J. Stuckey (Monash University, Australia)</strong></p>

<p>Risk-limiting post election audits guarantee a high probability of correcting incorrect election results, independent of why the result was incorrect.  Ballot-polling audits select ballots at random and interpret those ballots as evidence for and against the actual recorded result, continuing this process until either they support the recorded result, or they find evidence that it is wrong.  Ballot polling for first-past-the-post elections is well understood, and used in some US elections.  We define the first approach to ballot-polling risk-limiting audits for Instant Runoff Voting (IRV) elections.  We show that for almost all real elections we found, we can perform a risk-limiting audit by looking at only a small fraction of the total ballots.  The approach has now been used to audit actual elections in Colorado.</p>

<h3 id="garcia">Increasing Fairness in Online Multi-agent Combinatorial Optimisation</h3>
<p><strong>Maria Garcia de la Banda (Monash University, Australia)</strong></p>

<p>Production paradigms such as cloud or shared manufacturing must consider the heterogeneous objectives that result from different stakeholders (or agents) sharing resources.  While this points to fairness becoming increasingly important in online combinatorial optimisation, the fairness literature often ignores problems of online nature and with underlying NP-hard structures.  Solving these multi-agent problems with purely utilitarian objectives, which simply maximise the sum of the agents’ utilities, can be arbitrarily unfair.  Thus, ensuring some form of fairness among the agents is imperative.  The need is particularly interesting in the online setting, where consecutive combinatorial problems are solved, each taking into account any new requests the agents made in that time period (e.g. a week).  The online setting also allows us to consider and evaluate different metrics, as it decouples the overall fairness of the sequence of problems from the solving of each individual problem.  We present a problem- and solver-independent priority-balancing framework that can significantly increase the fairness of the overall solution without substantial decrease of utility, and we experimentally explore different fairness measures and different strategies to re-balance the agents’ priority for each individual problem.</p>

<h3 id="carlsson">The anatomy of the SICStus CLPFD solver</h3>
<p><strong>Mats Carlsson (Research Institutes of Sweden)</strong></p>

<p>A notable development in the history of CP was the realisation that unification in logic programming is a special case of constraint solving, leading to the constraint logic programming (CLP) framework.  This led to the development of innovative CLP solvers as well as to the integration of constraints into classic Prolog systems.</p>

<p>For such an integration, technical solutions must be found for many tasks like domain representation, constraint propagation, search, dedicated filtering algorithms, and peaceful coexistence with the Prolog virtual machine and runtime system.</p>

<p>This talk gives an overview of the CP subsystem of SICStus Prolog: the key extensions to Prolog that were necessary, details of the solver architecture, supporting both integers and reals, and a discussion of design choices.</p>

<p><strong>RosterLogic Variation: Building a Custom CBLS Solver for a Single Problem</strong></p>

<p>In "The Work Task Variation Problem" (CP 2025, Lagerkvist and Rattfeldt) we present a custom CBLS-like solver (built mainly in 2019) for solving the Work Task Variation (WTV) problem, and show that it is competitive for producing reasonable solutions quickly.  But why did we make the effort to build our own solver for solving a single problem, and was that a smart choice?  In this talk, I will dig deeper into why we built our own solver, including pragmatics, "business decisions", and the evolving landscape of combinatorial optimisation solvers over the last 6 years.</p>
