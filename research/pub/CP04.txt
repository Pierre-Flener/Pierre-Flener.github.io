Abstract:
We give an approximate and often extremely fast method of solving a
portfolio optimisation (PO) problem in financial mathematics, which
has applications in the credit derivatives market (synthetic CDO,
CDO^2, CDO squared, Russian-doll CDO, ...).  Its corresponding
satisfaction problem is closely related to the balanced incomplete
block design (BIBD) problem.  However, typical PO instances are an
order of magnitude larger than the largest BIBDs solved so far by
global search.  Our method is based on embedding sub-instances into
the original instance.  Their determination is itself a CSP.  This
allows us to solve a typical PO instance, with over 10^746 symmetries.
The high quality of our approximate solutions can be assessed by
comparison with a tight lower bound on the cost.  Also, our solutions
sufficiently improve the currently best ones so as to often make the
difference between having or not having a feasible transaction due to
investor and rating-agency constraints.
