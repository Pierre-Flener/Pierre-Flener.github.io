Call for papers for:


                       The 9th International Workshop on
             Constraint Modelling and Reformulation (ModRef 2010)

To be held at the 16th International Conference on the
Principles and Practice of Constraint Programming (CP 2010)

St. Andrews, Scotland (UK) Monday 6 September 2010 
Submission deadline:        Sunday 13 June 2010


Constraint Programming (CP) is a powerful technology to model and
solve combinatorial problems, which are ubiquitous in academia and
industry. The last ten years or so have witnessed significant research
devoted to modelling and solving problems with constraints. CP is now
a mature field and has been successfully used for tackling a wide
range of real-life complex applications. However, such a technology is
currently accessible to only a small number of experts. For CP to be
more widely used by non-experts, more research effort is needed in
order to ease the use of the CP technology. We solicit original papers
that contribute to widen the use of the CP technology.

Workshop topics include (but are not limited to):
     * Application papers describing interesting problems and interesting
       ways to model them;
     * Contributions to understanding modelling that could guide the
       manual or automatic formulation of models;
     * Identification of the criteria that should be used in evaluating
       models and the design of pragmatic techniques that facilitate the
       choice and possibly combination among alternative models;
     * Design of higher-level modelling languages;
     * Automatic reformulation techniques.

The previous workshops of this series were held in 2009, 2008, 2007,
2006, 2005, 2004, 2003, and 2002.



This will be a full-day workshop open to anyone interested in the
topic. The event will have a strong workshop flavour, with ample time
allocated to discussion.
