 <title>The "Flener" Name in Luxembourg</title>
</head>

<center><h1>The "Flener" Name in Luxembourg</h1></center>

<p>There are about fourty "Flener" households in Luxembourg, and a
total of maybe 100 people with that name there.  My paternal
grandfather researched the genealogy, and lost the trace in the 1600s.
Then we located quite a few "Flener"s in Austria, and now believe that
is where the name came from (via the Austrian occupation of Luxembourg
back then).  A lot of Luxembourgers emigrated to the USA in the early
20th century, but I ignore whether this also holds for Austria.</p>

<p>There are many close variations of the name, in Luxembourg and
Austria (and maybe Germany?): Floener, Flenner, Flehner, etc.  None of
these means anything, in Luxembourgish or any other Germanic language.
My father thought it could be an accidental contraction of the
Austrian surname "Hoflehner", which means somebody who "rents" (in its
medieval version, "lehen" in German) a farm ("Hof" in German) from the
local lord.</p>

<p>I am <a href=".">Pierre Flener</a> and have emigrated from
Luxembourg to Sweden.  My paternal grandfather was <a

(Guillaume) Flener</a>, whose father was <a
href="https://www.autorenlexikon.lu/page/author/242/2429/DEU/index.html">Nicolas
Flener</a>, whose father was <a
href="https://www.autorenlexikon.lu/page/author/232/2324/DEU/index.html">Wilhelm
(Guillaume) Flener</a>.  One person of the tree spawned by the latter
emigrated to Kansas, USA, in the early 1900s.</p>
