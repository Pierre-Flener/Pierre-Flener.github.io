<h1>Contact, Help, Ethics, and FAQ</h1>

<h2>Contact &amp; Help</h2>

<p>Before contacting anyone for help, please check whether your
question has an answer in the FAQ list below.  If not:</p>

<ul>

  <li><p>If you have a question about the <strong>lecture
  material</strong> or <strong>course organisation</strong>, then
  contact the <a href="../../contact.html">head teacher</a>.  An
  immediate answer will be given right before and after lectures, as
  well as during their breaks.</p></li>

  <li><p>If you have a question about the <strong>assignments</strong>
  or <strong>infrastructure</strong>, then contact the assistants at a
  help or solution session for an immediate answer.  Short
  <em>clarification</em> questions (that is: <em>not</em> about
  modelling or programming issues) that are either emailed to the
  <b>AD3 helpdesk</b> (rather than an individual teacher: see the AD3
  helpdesk discussion at Studium for the email address of the
  helpdesk) or posted to the AD3 helpdesk discussion at Studium are
  answered as soon as possible during working days and hours.  No
  answer means that you should go to a help session: almost all the
  assistants' budgeted time is allocated to grading and to the help,
  grading, and solution sessions.</p></li>

</ul>

<h2>Ethics</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://www.uu.se/en/staff/organisation-and-governance/regulations/routine-for-dealing-with-suspected-deceptive-conduct-in-examinations">legislation on plagiarism and cheating</a> (<a

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) and Answers</h2>

<h3>A. Generalities</h3>

<ol>

<li><p><strong>Will I get rich after passing this course?</strong>
Some of the wealthiest people on the planet made their fortunes from
clever algorithms and data structures, witness Sergey Brin and Larry
Page, inventors of the Google web search engine (valued at many
gazillions of sek).  Some of the wealthiest people in Sweden studied
at Uppsala University and went on to develop software needing clever
algorithms and data structures, witness some of the founders of OnGame
(acquired by bwin for about 4.5 billion sek), MySQL (acquired by Sun
Microsystems for about 6.3 billion sek), and Skype (acquired by eBay
for at least 17 billion sek).  There is no limit to the need for
efficient algorithms and data structures.

<h3>B. Lectures, Slides, and Literature</h3>

<ol>

<li><p><strong>Should I buy the textbook?</strong> The CLRS4 textbook,
available free-of-charge (courtesy the Swedish taxpayer!) as an <a
href="https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=nlebk&AN=2932690&site=ehost-live">e-book at the UU library</a>,
is a timeless classic and serves as a reference to many professional
programmers.  Its breadth of coverage, wealth of detail, and crisp
precision are daunting to some students, who may prefer another
pedagogical approach, such as in the reference book (which underlies
many of the slides), but many students grow to like these features.
Besides, the CLRS4 textbook is also used in other UU courses on
algorithm design.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>What to do if I missed a lecture?  Why are the lecture
slides so concise, rather than telling the complete story?</strong>
Lecture slides are <em>by design</em> just the backbone for
interactive teaching: they contain the essential results and
algorithms, so that no time is spent writing them to or from the
blackboard.  Also, a teacher complements this backbone with a lot of
important insights, both in writing on the blackboard and in talking,
so you ought to take notes in order to document the complete story.
If you take no notes or missed a lecture, then the slides alone often
do not suffice to reconstruct the complete story, so you should then
consult other sources, such as the textbook and the <a
href="resources.html">Resources</a>, and should ask an attending
student (not a teacher) which material was covered in your
absence.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Why do you give page ranges for the externally stored
Princeton slides instead of locally storing downloads without the
skipped slides?</strong> The skipped Princeton slides often have
examples that we skip for reasons of time and <a
href="https://www.uu.se/en/study/course?query=1DL481">required
theoretical content</a>, so their removal would deprive us of other
replies to FAQs B.6 and C.1 below.  Also, the Princeton slides may
dynamically evolve during the course as clarifications are added,
ambiguities are resolved, and errors are corrected by their author
(often in reaction to our feedback from UU), so a locally stored
projection of their content would deprive us of these
enhancements.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>What pages of the CLRS4 textbook should I
read?</strong> See the reading instructions in the table at <a
href="lectures.html">Lectures, Slides, and Literature</a>.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>What are the practical applications of the discussed
algorithms and data structures?</strong> Most batches of slides list a
lot of practical applications.  Each algorithm and data structure has
an abstract name so that one does not risk thinking its scope is
restricted to a particular application.</p></li>

<!--
<li><p><strong>Why all this theory in the course?  Why is it at
the beginning of the course?  Is it useful?</strong> In order to
discuss in a scientific way the relative merits of alternative
algorithms or data structures for a given purpose, we need an analytic
way of predicting their performance, rather than experimentally and
inaccurately measuring it in milliseconds or bytes.  The (few!)
notions seen are among the most celebrated of computing science and
will transcend the rest of your studies as well as any programmer
career.</p></li>
-->

<li><p><strong>Why are there not more examples and solved exercises in
lectures?</strong> Like every course, AD3 has a <a
href="https://www.uu.se/en/study/course?query=1DL481">required
theoretical content</a> (which is <em><strong>not</strong></em>
decided by the head teacher) and the standard time budget (students
are 33% fulltime on AD3, and no teacher is anywhere near fulltime on
AD3): the balance of theory and practice in the lectures simply
follows from these data and is not a sign of our bad will.  On the
contrary, if allocated more time (but this is impossible), then we
would love to offer additional practical problem solving sessions.
Note that the CLRS4 textbook and the skipped Princeton slides (which
are based on the reference book) often have additional examples (see
reply to FAQ B.3 above), that the website of the CLRS4 textbook has
solutions to many of its exercises, and that there are help sessions
and solution sessions for the assignments.</p></li>

</ol>

<h3>C. Assignments, Help Sessions, Grading Sessions, and Solution
Sessions</h3>  <!-- , and Presentation -->

<ol>

<li><p><strong>Why are there not more assistants?  Why are there not
more examples and solved / supervised exercises by assistants in
lessons?</strong> Like every course, AD3 has the standard time budget
(students are 33% fulltime on AD3, and no teacher is anywhere near
fulltime on AD3): the number of scheduled events simply follows from
these data and is not a sign of our bad will.  On the contrary, if
allocated more time (but this is impossible), then we would love to
offer additional practical problem solving sessions.  Note that the
CLRS4 textbook and the skipped Princeton slides (which are based on
the reference book) often have additional examples (see reply to FAQ
B.3 above), that the website of the CLRS4 textbook has solutions to
many of its exercises, and that there are help sessions and solution
sessions for the assignments.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>How do I best use my time, and yours, in order to solve
an assignment?</strong> Prepare your solution as far as possible until
the corresponding help sessions, in order to make best use of that
reserved timespan of personal attention by the assistants.  This is
much more effective than going to a help session, printing out the
assignment (which was published at least a week before the first help
session and often does not require any material taught in the
meantime), and not meeting all the difficulties until the end of the
two session hours.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Why is there not more email support for the
assignments?</strong> We have scheduled almost all the standard time
budget for the lectures, help sessions, grading sessions, solution
sessions, grading, and preparation.  This is why we can only answer to
emailed short <em>clarification</em> questions that trigger brief
reply times, and this is a more personal and rational way of spending
the standard time budget: more email support would inevitably result
in fewer help sessions.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>I am lost!  Why do the assignment instructions not tell
us <em>how</em> to solve the questions?</strong> Stating only
<em>what</em> output has to be computed from the inputs is a
pedagogical choice.  In real-life engineering problems, you are not
asked to solve a problem by using method <em>m</em> on page <em>p</em>
of textbook <em>t</em>.  Come to some of the help sessions of an
assignment in order to get advice on what is wrong with your current
solution or get hints on <em>how</em> to proceed.  If you think a
programming task is insufficiently described in terms of its pre- and
post-conditions, then contact the teachers: we vet problem
descriptions with utmost care and no flaws are due to purpose or
sloppiness.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Why are there not a lot of small assignments rather
than the few bigger ones?</strong> Algorithm and data structure design
is best practised not by drill of small questions with no relation to
each other or real life, but by tackling bigger assignments, which
have been selected as examples of the infinite variety of interesting
algorithmic questions that occur in real life.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Why do we need to hand in reports in addition to
programs?</strong> This is an algorithms course and your models or
programs for combinatorial optimisation problems have to be
experimentally evaluated, hence a report is needed, as we are not just
interested in your models and programs, but also in <em>how</em> you
discovered and evaluated them.  Also note that this course was chosen
in order to fulfil the curriculum goal of the ability to communicate
in writing: see the last of the <a
href="https://www.uu.se/en/study/course?query=1DL481">learning
outcomes of the course</a>.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Why do we not get more finegrained feedback on our
assignment reports and programs?</strong> Our solution sessions are a
more rational way to use the standard time budget: we give collective
feedback instead of finegrained team-wise feedback.  More detailed
comments can be obtained orally from the assistants upon
appointment.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Why can I not do the assignments alone?</strong>
Teamwork is usually a very rewarding experience, whether you learn
from or teach to the other student, especially for a course like this
where the assignments are unlike almost everything you have seen
before: choose a partner whose skills are not interchangeable with
yours.  Note that the assignments are calibrated somewhat smaller for
the students who work alone and have an approved reason for
this.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Why is there no bonus system?</strong> Since the
introduction of anonymous exams, the handling of bonus systems is much
more time-consuming for the teachers: the students cannot have it both
ways.  The compensation offered in this course is that the assignments
no longer have a pass/fail grade but a 3/4/5 grade and that the
overall grade is no longer the exam grade but a function of the
assignment grade and the exam grade.
<!-- , though no lower than the exam grade.-->
</p></li>

</ol>

<h3>D. Exam, Grades, and Credits</h3>

<ol>

<li><p><strong>I will miss (or have missed) a mandatory event: is
pre-booked travel considered force majeure?</strong> Of course
<em><strong>not</strong></em>: full-time students are expected to work
full-time during all working days and working hours, so all absences
are at the risk of the student and no exceptions are made for
travelling students, especially that the schedules, including the
mandatory events, are published many weeks in advance.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>I nearly passed the exam.  What can I do to avoid
taking the next exam?</strong> No make-up opportunities will be
created for near-passes, as the head teacher evaluates those cases
very carefully before announcing the exam results.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>I passed the exam or assignments, but why are my
credits not reported yet to Ladok?</strong> Studium is
<em><strong>not</strong></em> automatically reporting awarded credits
to Ladok, but there is a manual process involved in that.  So be
patient and do not worry until at least a month after the official end
of the study period.</p></li>

</ol>

<h3>E. Resources, Contact, Help, Ethics, FAQ, Course Evaluations, and Feedback</h3>

<ol>

<li><p><strong>How do I install LaTeX or the MIP, SAT, and SMT solvers
on my own computer?</strong> Follow the links at the <a
href="resources.html">Resources</a>.  We have no resources to help you
with installation issues, since we provide you with installation-free
options.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Why do I not get a reply to my query?</strong> On
working days and hours, you can normally expect a reply within a few
hours, provided it is either emailed to the AD3 helpdesk (rather than
an individual teacher) or posted to the AD3 helpdesk discussion at
Studium, is a <em>clarification</em> question, is brief, is unanswered
in this FAQ, and is answerable in a short time.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Are you interested in additional links to great
internet resources?</strong> Yes, absolutely!  Send us an email with
links, and we will add the best ones to the course web-pages.</p></li>
