<h1>Algorithms and Data Structures III (course 1DL481)</h1>

<p>(<a href="../course.html">back to the course homepage</a>)</p>

<h1>Exam</h1>

<p>There is a 3-hour long individual, written, <b><em>closed-book</em></b>
exam at the end of the course, where you can only use blank paper,
pencils, and an eraser, that is
<b><em>no</em></b> help: <b><em>no</em></b> books,
<b><em>no</em></b> slides, <b><em>no</em></b> notes,
<b><em>no</em></b> electronic devices,
<!--
  (except for downloading the questions and uploading scans of your answers),
  <b><em>no</em></b> interaction with other people,
-->
etc:</p>

<ul>

  <li><p>Exam: Fri 14 Mar 2025, time and place to be announced
  <!-- from 14:00 to 17:00 in hall 1 at Bergsbrunnagatan 15 -->
  </p></li>

<li><p>First re-exam: June 2025, time and place to be announced</p></li>

<li><p>Second re-exam: August 2025, time and place to be announced</p></li>

</ul>

<p>Previous exams: <a href="March24.pdf">2024</a>, <a
href="March23.pdf">2023</a>, <a href="March22.pdf">2022</a>, <a
href="March21.pdf">2021</a>, <a href="March20.pdf">2020</a>, <a

<p>PhD students do either the exam, or just the <a
href="../assignments.html">assignments</a> (both solo), or all of
these: contact the head teacher.</p>

<p>There will be a question on establishing NP-completeness for some
problem, and at least half the points of that question must be earned
in order to pass the exam.  The exam questions will be drawn from the
following list or will be very similar to questions in this list:</p>

<ul>

<li><p><b>Probabilistic Analysis:</b> Exercises 5.2-{1,2,3,5,6} of
CLRS4.</p></li>

<li><p><b>Randomised Algorithms:</b> Exercises 5.3-{2,3,4} of
CLRS4.</p></li>

<li><p><b>Amortised Analysis:</b> Exercises 16.1-{1,3} of CLRS4;
Exercises 16.2-{1,2} of CLRS4; and Exercise 16.3-2 of CLRS4.</p></li>

<li><p><b>NP-Completeness:</b> Exercise 34.5-2 of CLRS4 by following
the hint in <em>one</em> step; Exercises 34.5-{3,5,6,7} of CLRS4;
Problem 34-1ab of CLRS4 by following the hint in <em>one</em> step;
Exercise 35.3-2 of CLRS4; and Problem 35-1a of CLRS4 by following the
hint in <em>one</em> step.</p></li>

<li><p><b>Approximation Algorithms:</b> Exercises 35.1-{1,5} of
CLRS4; Exercise 35.4-2 of CLRS4; and Problems 35-{1bcde,3} of
CLRS4.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>Since it is a closed-book exam, the questions will be asked in a
self-contained way.</p>

<p>Exam study groups are allowed and even encouraged, as the exam is
individual.  The exam topics are taught as early as possible towards
maximising the time available for exam preparation.</p>


<h2>Expected Effort</h2>

<p>One higher-education credit (ECTS credit) translates under Swedish
university law into an expected 26.67 hours of work for the average
student.  Hence 133.33 hours are expected on this 5-credit course.</p>

<p>The exam is worth 3 credits.  The actual preparation and taking of
the exam are expected to take 52 hours.  Recall also that 21 hours are
spent on attending the lectures and that 60 hours are expected on
working for the 2 credits for the <a
href="../assignments.html">assignments</a>.</p>

<p>All this does not clash with other courses you are taking, as
university studies are legally defined to take 400 hours of work per
study period (normally 10 weeks), and the standard 15 credits targeted
in a study period are calibrated to reach that total.</p>

<h2>Exam Grade</h2>

<p>The <strong>exam grade</strong> is determined by a <a
href="../grades.html#exam">published scale</a>, depending on the exam
score.</p>

<h2>Overall Grade</h2>

<p>The <strong>overall grade</strong> is determined by a <a
href="../grades.html#overall">published scale</a>, depending on the <a
href="../assignments.html">assignment</a> and exam scores.</p>
