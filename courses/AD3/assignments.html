<h1>Algorithms and Data Structures III (course 1DL481)</h1>

<p>(<a href="course.html">back to the course homepage</a>)</p>

<h1>Assignments</h1>

<p>There are 2 mandatory <strong>assignments</strong>, to be done in
<strong>teams</strong>.  The assignments are worth 2 higher-education
credits (ECTS credits) in total.</p>

<p>PhD students do either the assignments (both solo), or just the <a
href="exam/">exam</a>, or all of these: contact the head teacher.</p>

<h2>Assignments</h2>

<p>The main objective of the assignments (numbered 1 to 2 below, whose
statements will appear in due time) is to exercise the theoretical
knowledge gained in the lectures whose material is
<em><strong>not</em></strong> covered by the exam, on carefully
selected problems of our choice: the assignments thus constitute a
take-home part of the exam.  We are not just interested in
sufficiently correct and efficient code, but also in explanations and
experimental evaluations, hence a report is also required for each
assignment and its quality has an impact on the score.</p>

<p>For each assignment, the assistants supervise 3 <strong>help
sessions</strong> for troubleshooting in the preparation of your
reports.  Each assignment has 2 independent problems, each yielding a
<strong>problem score</strong> in \(0..5\), hence there is a maximum
of 20 points to earn.  Insufficiently good reports can be defended
orally to an assistant in scheduled <strong>grading sessions</strong>.
Solutions are discussed by the assistants in <strong>solution
sessions</strong>.</p>

<h3>Help Sessions</h3>

<p>The objective of a help session is <em><strong>only</strong></em>
for the assistants to help you prepare an acceptable solution for the
assignment with the closest upcoming deadline.  The assignment
problems will normally be published at least a week prior to the first
help session.  Also, the necessary course material will normally have
been presented in lectures at least a week prior to the first help
session.  You are thus able and even <em><strong>strongly
encouraged</strong></em> to prepare your solution as far as possible
until the help sessions and to attend them, in order to make best use
of that reserved time span of personal attention by the assistants.</p>

<p>Note that <em><strong>no</strong></em> further tutoring on lecture
topics, such as exercises whose solutions are given or to be handed in
at the end of the session, will be performed by the assistants at the
help sessions.</p>

<h3>Initial Grading</h3>

<p>For each problem of an assignment, your <strong>initial
score</strong>, in the integer interval 0..5, will normally be
determined by the late afternoon on the day before the grading session
for that assignment.  Toward this, the assistants run your code on a
grading test suite and examines the corresponding part of your report.
An initial score is the <strong>final score</strong> if in the set
{0,3,4,5}.</p>

<h3>Grading Session</h3>

<p>The objective of a grading session is to determine your
<strong>final score</strong> for each problem with an initial score in
the set {1,2}: your team will normally be given an appointment with an
assistant during the grading session, in a room of her/his choice,
toward correcting <em><strong>minor</em></strong> mistakes during that
meeting and possibly increasing your score by one unit.  An initial
score of 1 upon only <em><strong>major</em></strong> mistakes cannot
be increased at a grading session.</p>

<p>Appointment times are <em><strong>strict</strong></em>: the initial
score is final in case of a missed appointment.  Exceptions must be
negotiated in due time during working hours with the head teacher,
upon reporting a convincing case of force majeure.</p>

<h3>Solution Session</h3>

<p>The objective of a solution session is
<em><strong>only</strong></em> for the assistants to discuss
acceptable solutions to the assignment of the previous deadline.
<em><strong>No</strong></em> code will be handed out.  The first
solution session is merged with the initial help session to the second
assignment.</p>

<p>Comments on your submitted report can be found at Studium; more
detailed comments can be obtained orally from the assistants upon
appointment.</p>

<p>Note that <em><strong>no</strong></em> further tutoring on lecture
topics, such as exercises whose solutions are given or to be handed in
at the end of the session, will be performed by the assistants at the
solution sessions.</p>

<h2>Submission and Deadlines</h2>

<p>All assignment reports must be submitted electronically via
Studium, whose clock may be different from yours.  Submission
deadlines are <em><strong>hard</strong></em>.  Exceptions must be
negotiated in due time during working hours with the head teacher,
upon reporting a convincing case of force majeure.  Grading will only
start after a deadline, so you can submit multiple times until
then.</p>

<h2>Teams</h2>

<p>For pedagogic and resource reasons, every assignment report
<em><strong>must</strong></em> be prepared by a team of 2 students,
both being first-time students or both being non-first-time students
of this course.  <em><strong>No</strong></em> permission will ever be
granted for teams of three or more students.  PhD students must work
solo.</p>

<p>Until 23:59 of Sun 26 Jan 2025, you can declare a team at Studium:
both teammates must consent to forming a team.  If you are not
formally registered yet, then you can declare your team by email to
the AD3 helpdesk.  You are strongly encouraged to advertise your
search for a partner at the <em>Teammate Search</em> discussion at
Studium.  If you are however fine with a
<em><strong>randomly</strong></em> allotted teammate, then declare
this by email to the AD3 helpdesk by that hard deadline or add your
name to one of the random teams at Studium: you might not get any
teammate, because you are the odd one out or because the assigned one
drops the course on short notice, so <em><strong>start working
solo</strong></em> on Assignment 1 in order to guard against this
possibility.  All students who have done neither of those actions by
that hard deadline will be considered to have dropped the course, but
will not be unregistered by us: their submitted assignment reports
will normally not be graded.</p>

<p>Teams may change between assignments: permission will be granted,
as long as you inform the AD3 helpdesk by email in advance and the
total number of teams does not increase.</p>

<p>Only <em><strong>one</strong></em> teammate of each team should
submit each assignment report.</p>

<p>Exceptions for solo work must be negotiated in due time with the
head teacher, during working hours, upon reporting a convincing case
of force majeure.  The assignments are calibrated somewhat smaller for
those students.  Such an exception is only valid for the assignment(s)
it was negotiated for.</p>

<h2 id="ethics">Ethics</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://www.uu.se/en/staff/organisation-and-governance/regulations/routine-for-dealing-with-suspected-deceptive-conduct-in-examinations">legislation on plagiarism and cheating</a> (<a
href="../../ethics.html">summary</a>) of Uppsala University will be
rigorously applied, without exceptions.  This disallows using a public
repository (such as GitHub, where you should use a <a
href="https://education.github.com/pack">free private student
repository</a>) for code management within your team.  We reserve the
right to use plagiarism detection tools and point out that they are
extremely powerful.</p>

<p><em><strong>When submitting you implicitly certify that your report
and all its uploaded attachments were produced solely by your team,
except where explicitly stated otherwise and clearly referenced, that
each teammate can individually explain any part starting from the
moment of submitting your report, and that your report and attachments
are not freely accessible on a public repository.</strong></em></p>

<p>We reserve the right to give different assignment scores to the
teammates of a team, depending on the performance at the grading
session.</p>

<p>Please report any problems within a team to the head teacher, who
will handle the case in confidence, in the best interest of both
teammates, keeping the ethics dimension in mind.</p>

<h2>Expected Effort</h2>

<p>One higher-education credit (ECTS credit) translates under Swedish
university law into an expected 26.67 hours of work for the average
student.  Hence 133.33 hours are expected on this 5-credit course.</p>

<p>The assignments are worth 2 credits in total.  Not counting the 21
hours spent on attending the lectures, <em><strong>the 2 assignments
are calibrated to take an average of 30 hours each, for the average
student, for each teammate, including the corresponding help, grading,
and solution sessions</strong></em>.</p>

<p>All this does not clash with other courses you are taking, as
university studies are legally defined to take 400 hours of work per
study period (normally 10 weeks), and the standard 15 credits targeted
in a study period are calibrated to reach that total.</p>

<p>Do not expect the 2 assignments to be equally labour-intensive, and
do not expect the 2 problems of each assignment to be equally
labour-intensive.</p>

<h2>Assignment Grade</h2>

<p>Each <strong>assignment score</strong> is the sum of the final
scores of each of its problems.  The <strong>assignment grade</strong>
is determined by a <a href="grades.html#assignments">published
scale</a>, depending on the assignment scores.</p>

<h2>Need Help?</h2>

<p>See <a href="contact.html">Contact, Help, Ethics, and FAQ</a>.</p>

<h2>Overall Grade</h2>

<p>The <strong>overall grade</strong> is determined by a <a
href="grades.html#overall">published scale</a>, depending on the
assignment scores and the <a href="exam/index.html">exam</a>
score.</p>

<h2>Contract</h2>

<p>These rules are effective as of Mon 20 Jan 2025.  The head teacher
reserves the right to modify them at any moment, should special
circumstances call for this.</p>
