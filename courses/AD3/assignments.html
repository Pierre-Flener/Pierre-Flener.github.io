<h1>Algorithms and Data Structures III (course 1DL481)</h1>

<p>(<a href="course.html">back to the course homepage</a>)</p>

<h1>Assignments</h1>
<!-- <h1>Assignments and Oral Presentation</h1> -->

<p>There are 2 mandatory <strong>assignments</strong>, to be done in
<strong>teams</strong>.
<!--
Further, each team must make a short <strong>oral
presentation</strong>, using slides, on an algorithm or a data
structure or an NP-completeness/hardness reduction within the exam
topics of this course, during one of the 3
<em><strong>mandatory</strong></em> lecture slots of Wednesday 10
March 2021: each missed presentation session (in case of no force
majeure) can be compensated for by writing a two-page summary of a
research paper chosen by the head teacher.  A detailed timeslot
allocation will be published in due time.  Together,
-->
The assignments
<!-- and oral presentation -->
are worth 2 higher-education credits (ECTS credits) in total.</p>

<p>PhD students do either the assignments
<!-- and oral presentation -->
(both solo), or just the <a href="exam/">exam</a>, or all of these:
contact the head teacher.</p>

<h2>Assignments</h2>

<p>The main objective of the assignments (numbered 1 to 2 below, whose
statements will appear in due time) is to exercise the theoretical
knowledge gained in the lectures whose material is
<em><strong>not</em></strong> covered by the exam, on carefully
selected problems of our choice: the assignments thus constitute a
take-home part of the exam.  We are not just interested in
sufficiently correct and efficient code, but also in explanations and
experimental evaluations, hence a report is also required for each
assignment and its quality has an impact on the score: see the <a
href="demoReport/demoReport.pdf">AD3 demo report</a> (LaTeX <a
href="demoReport">source</a>) for imposed document structure and an
indication of the expected quality of content.</p>

<p>For each assignment, the assistants supervise 3 <strong>help
sessions</strong> for troubleshooting in the preparation of your
reports.  Each assignment has 2 independent problems, each yielding a
<strong>problem score</strong> in \(0..5\), hence there is a maximum
of 20 points to earn.  Insufficiently good reports can be defended
orally to an assistant in scheduled <strong>grading sessions</strong>.
Solutions are discussed by the assistants in <strong>solution
sessions</strong>.</p>

<h3>Help Sessions</h3>

<p>The objective of a help session is <em><strong>only</strong></em>
for the assistants to help you prepare an acceptable solution for the
assignment with the closest upcoming deadline.  The assignment
problems will normally be published at least a week prior to the first
help session.  Also, the necessary course material will normally have
been presented in lectures at least a week prior to the first help
session.  You are thus able and even <em><strong>strongly
encouraged</strong></em> to prepare your solution as far as possible
until the help sessions and to attend them, in order to make best use
of that reserved time span of personal attention by the assistants.</p>

<p>Note that <em><strong>no</strong></em> further tutoring on lecture
topics, such as exercises whose solutions are given or to be handed in
at the end of the session, will be performed by the assistants at the
help sessions.</p>

<h3>Initial Grading</h3>

<p>For each problem of an assignment, your <strong>initial
score</strong>, in the integer interval 0..5, will normally be
determined by the late afternoon on the day before the grading session
for that assignment.  Toward this, the assistants run your code on a
grading test suite and examines the corresponding part of your report.
An initial score is the <strong>final score</strong> if in the set
{0,3,4,5}.</p>

<h3>Grading Session</h3>

<p>The objective of a grading session is to determine your
<strong>final score</strong> for each problem with an initial score in
the set {1,2}: your team will normally be given an appointment with an
assistant during the grading session, in a room of her/his choice,
toward correcting <em><strong>minor</em></strong> mistakes during that
meeting and possibly increasing your score by one unit.  An initial
score of 1 upon only <em><strong>major</em></strong> mistakes cannot
be increased at a grading session.</p>

<p>Appointment times are <em><strong>strict</strong></em>: the initial
score is final in case of a missed appointment.  Exceptions must be
negotiated in due time during working hours with the head teacher,
upon reporting a convincing case of force majeure.</p>

<h3>Solution Session</h3>

<p>The objective of a solution session is
<em><strong>only</strong></em> for the assistants to discuss
acceptable solutions to the assignment of the previous deadline.
<em><strong>No</strong></em> code will be handed out.  The first
solution session is merged with the initial help session to the second
assignment.</p>

<p>Comments on your submitted report can be found at Studium; more
detailed comments can be obtained orally from the assistants upon
appointment.</p>

<p>Note that <em><strong>no</strong></em> further tutoring on lecture
topics, such as exercises whose solutions are given or to be handed in
at the end of the session, will be performed by the assistants at the
solution sessions.</p>

<h2>Oral Presentation</h2>

<p>Pick a well-cited (at least 100 citations), well-published (in a
journal with a reasonably high impact factor, say at least 1.000
during the year of publication, or in the proceedings of a prestigious
conference), and peer-reviewed academic paper on an algorithm or a
data structure or an NP-completeness/hardness reduction within the
<em><strong>exam topics</strong></em> of this course (Chapters 5, 16,
34, and 35 of CLRS4, plus its Section 11.3.4).  You may also start
from a chapter in a well-respected textbook.  Advice: It is often
dangerous to rely on pre-print versions (at authors' homepages or so),
as they often do not reflect all the changes (including error
corrections) made upon the peer-reviewing process, so use UU's free
access (from UU IP addresses, courtesy the Swedish taxpayer) through
the pay-walls of many for-profit academic publishers in order to read
the official final version and use that version when proposing a
presentation topic.</p>

<p>Submit your proposed presentation topic (with the CLRS4 chapter
number and, in the case of a journal or conference paper: the title,
the authors, the full link of the <a
href="https://www.doi.org">DOI</a>, the citation count according to <a
href="https://scholar.google.com">Google Scholar</a>, the full journal
or conference name, and the <a href="https://www.bioxbio.com">journal
impact factor</a>) at Studium (as a file in either .pdf or .txt
format; all other formats will be rejected) by the deadline given
below.  The head teacher may via Studium interactively negotiate a
revision with you during the subsequent six days until ideally his
approval: if approved, then <em><strong>pass</strong></em>, else
<em><strong>fail</strong></em>.</p>

<p>An approved presentation topic entitles to an oral presentation,
all presentations taking place in spring 2021 in the Zoom room for the
lectures.  The schedule of all presentations, during the 3
<em><strong>mandatory</strong></em> lecture slots of Wednesday 10
March 2021, is done by thematic grouping:</p>
<ul>
  <li>10:15 to 11:00: Teams 13 and 16: NP-completeness</li>
  <li>11:15 to 12:00: Teams 14 and 15: NP-completeness</li> 
  <li>13:15 to 14:00: Teams 23 and 27: randomised algorithms</li>
  <li>14:15 to 15:00: Teams 20 and 32: randomised algorithms and
    amortised analysis, respectively</li>
  <li>15:15 to 16:00: Teams 11 and 10: approximation algorithms</li>
  <li>16:15 to 17:00: Teams 25 and 30: approximation algorithms</li>
</ul>
<p>Consider your presentation as part of an AD3 lecture, so set the
standard to what you would expect from a teacher:</p>
<ul>
  <li>use slides made on a computer; you may start from, or just
  re-use, already published slides, as long as you give proper credit
  to their authors;</li>
  <li>repeat the information from the topic proposal (see above)</a>;</li>
  <li>specify (in plain English, with a suitable
  amount of pictures and mathematical notation) the problem (in case of
  an NP-completeness/hardness reduction), algorithm, or data
  structure;</li>
  <li>state real-life application(s) thereof;</li>
  <li>for an algorithm (on a data structure): give an ideally
  graphical animation of at least one sample run;</li>
  <li>for a randomised algorithm: <em>also</em> outline the derivation
  of its expected runtime (and memory) complexity;</li>
  <li>for an approximation algorithm: do <em>not</em> prove the
  NP-hardness of the problem, but <em>do</em> outline the derivation
  of the approximation ratio, state the tightness of that ratio, and
  argue why the algorithm takes time polynomial in the input size;</li>
  <li>present only the essence of the paper (rather than all the
  details): the objective is to <em>teach</em>, at a suitable pace,
  not to rush through too much material.</li>
  <li>experiment in advance with the projector in the classroom,
  to ensure you can successfully connect your hardware quickly and
  that your chosen fonts (minimum 22pt) and colour schemes are
  readable from anywhere in the classroom;</li>
  <li>experiment in advance with the acoustics in the classroom,
  to ensure your voice carries to the last occupied row of seats.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your presentation can be either pre-recorded and uploaded with
filename <em>t</em><tt>-presentation</tt>, where <em>t</em> is your
team number, or live.  You are encouraged to pre-record and upload
your presentation (find the link at Studium), so that the Zoom host (a
teacher) plays it (this works much better under Zoom than when a
participant plays it), but you can also present live: either way, your
faces must be visible during your presentation, which must be 12 to 15
minutes long (and will be interrupted after 15 minutes).  The
presentation sessions will not be recorded, and pre-recorded
presentations will not be made accessible anywhere.</p>

<p>You earn a <em><strong>pass</strong></em> grade if and only if both
the head teacher and the assistants deem your presentation successful,
in the sense that (1) it was intelligible to anyone who paid attention
during the AD3 lectures (hence you need <em>not</em> define any AD3
concepts) and pedagogically explained all the background material not
in AD1 to AD3 and their prerequisites; (2) it was neither way too
short nor too long (you will be stopped once your time is up, in order
to try and ensure that we stay within the schedule, and there will be
an audible alarm two minutes in advance); (3) the teammates of a team
spoke for about the same time and on about equally complex material;
and (4) the slides are well-polished (spell-checked, grammar-checked,
etc) and uploaded by the deadline given below.</p>

<p>Again, attendance at all 3 lecture slots with oral presentations is
<strong><em>mandatory</em></strong>: each missed presentation session
(in case of no force majeure) can be compensated for by writing a
two-page summary of a research paper chosen by the head teacher.</p>

<h2>Submission and Deadlines</h2>

<p>All assignment reports, with <a
href="demoReport/demoReport.pdf">imposed structure</a> (LaTeX <a
href="demoReport">source</a>),
<!-- and presentation deliverables -->
must be submitted electronically via Studium, whose clock may be
different from yours.  Submission deadlines are
<em><strong>hard</strong></em>.  Exceptions must be negotiated in due
time during working hours with the head teacher, upon reporting a
convincing case of force majeure.  Grading will only start after a
deadline, so you can submit multiple times until then.</p>

<h2>Teams</h2>

<p>For pedagogic and resource reasons, every assignment report
<!-- and every oral presentation -->
<em><strong>must</strong></em> be prepared by a team of 2 students,
both being first-time students or both being non-first-time students
of this course.  <em><strong>No</strong></em> permission will ever be
granted for teams of three or more students.  PhD students must work
solo.</p>

<p>Until 23:59 of Sun 21 Jan 2024, you can declare a team at Studium:
both teammates must consent to forming a team.  If you are not
formally registered yet, then you can declare your team by email to
the AD3 helpdesk.  You are strongly encouraged to advertise your
search for a partner at the <em>Teammate Search</em> discussion at
Studium.  If you are however fine with a
<em><strong>randomly</strong></em> allotted teammate, then declare
this by email to the AD3 helpdesk by that hard deadline or add your
name to one of the random teams at Studium: you might not get any
teammate, because you are the odd one out or because the assigned one
drops the course on short notice, so <em><strong>start working
solo</strong></em> on Assignment 1 in order to guard against this
possibility.  All students who have done neither of those actions by
that hard deadline will be considered to have dropped the course, but
will not be unregistered by us: their submitted assignment reports
will normally not be graded.</p>

<p>Teams may change between assignments:
<!-- and prior to the oral presentation: -->
permission will be granted, as long as you inform the AD3 helpdesk by
email in advance and the total number of teams does not increase.</p>

<p>Only <em><strong>one</strong></em> teammate of each team should
submit each assignment report.
<!-- or presentation deliverable. -->
</p>

<p>Exceptions for solo work must be negotiated in due time with the
head teacher, during working hours, upon reporting a convincing case
of force majeure.  The assignments are calibrated somewhat smaller for
those students.  Such an exception is only valid for the assignment(s)
it was negotiated for.</p>

<h2 id="ethics">Ethics</h2>

<p>The legislation on plagiarism and cheating (<a
href="../../ethics.html">summary</a>) of Uppsala University will be
rigorously applied, without exceptions.  This disallows using a public
repository (such as GitHub, where you should use a <a
href="https://education.github.com/pack">free private student
repository</a>) for code management within your team.  We reserve the
right to use plagiarism detection tools and point out that they are
extremely powerful.</p>

<p><em><strong>When submitting you implicitly certify that your report
and all its uploaded attachments were produced solely by your team,
except where explicitly stated otherwise and clearly referenced, that
each teammate can individually explain any part starting from the
moment of submitting your report, and that your report and attachments
are not freely accessible on a public repository.</strong></em></p>

<p>We reserve the right to give different assignment scores to the
teammates of a team, depending on the performance at the grading
session.</p>

<p>Please report any problems within a team to the head teacher, who
will handle the case in confidence, in the best interest of both
teammates, keeping the ethics dimension in mind.</p>

<h2>Expected Effort</h2>

<p>One higher-education credit (ECTS credit) translates under Swedish
university law into an expected 26.67 hours of work for the average
student.  Hence 133.33 hours are expected on this 5-credit course.</p>

<p>The assignments are worth 2 credits in total.  Not counting the 18
hours spent on attending the lectures,
<!-- and presentation sessions, -->
<em><strong>the 2 assignments are calibrated to take an average of 30
hours each, for the average student, for each teammate, including the
corresponding help, grading, and solution sessions</strong></em>.</p>

<!--
<p>The oral presentation counts as preparation for the exam, but we
bundle its pass/fail reporting with the reporting of the assignments.
The preparation of your oral presentation is expected to take 15
hours.</p>
-->

<p>All this does not clash with other courses you are taking, as
university studies are legally defined to take 400 hours of work per
study period (normally 10 weeks), and the standard 15 credits targeted
in a study period are calibrated to reach that total.</p>

<p>Do not expect the 2 assignments to be equally labour-intensive, and
do not expect the 2 problems of each assignment to be equally
labour-intensive.</p>

<h2>Assignment Grade</h2>

<p>Each <strong>assignment score</strong> is the sum of the final
scores of each of its problems.  The <strong>assignment grade</strong>
is determined by a <a href="grades.html#assignments">published
scale</a>, depending on the assignment scores.
<!-- and the oral presentation. -->
</p>

<h2>Need Help?</h2>

<p>See <a href="contact.html">Contact, Help, Ethics, and FAQ</a>.</p>

<h2>Overall Grade</h2>

<p>The <strong>overall grade</strong> is determined by a <a
href="grades.html#overall">published scale</a>, depending on the
assignment scores and the <a href="exam/index.html">exam</a>
score.</p>

<!--
<h2>Failure</h2>

<p>There is normally no complementation opportunity as the full
budgeted time of the teachers is allocated within the two periods
where the courses take place: with two or three help sessions and one
grading session per assignment, there is a lot of support available
for submitting and improving a report that clears the low 20%
threshold (not 50% like in other courses!) per assignment, and for
clearing the 50% threshold over all assignments.</p>

<p>The lecture contents, assignment questions, submission rules, or
head teacher of a course can change from one academic year to another,
and the incremental completion of assignment duties over the years is
<em><strong>not</strong></em> a student right: it is best to complete
(the assignments of) a course the year it is taken. The head teacher
stopped granting that right as the administration thereof turned out
to be more time-consuming than the alternative.</p>

-->

<h2>Contract</h2>

<p>These rules are effective as of Mon 15 Jan 2024.  The head teacher
reserves the right to modify them at any moment, should special
circumstances call for this.</p>
