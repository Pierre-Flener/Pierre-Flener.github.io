  %% Delete this paragraph:
  \noindent
  This document imposes the \emph{structure} of an assignment report
  for this course.  The \LaTeX\ source code of this document
  exemplifies almost everything you need to know about \LaTeX\ in
  order to typeset a professional-looking assignment report (for this
  course).  Use it as a starting point for imitation and delete
  everything irrelevant.  The usage of \LaTeX\ is \emph{optional}, but
  highly recommended, for reasons that will soon become clear to those
  who have never used it before: any learning time is \emph{outside}
  the budget of this course, but will hugely pay off, if not in this
  course then in the next course(s) you take and when writing a thesis
  or other scientific report. \medskip

  %% Delete this paragraph:
  Replace every blue text by your text (or just delete it, where
  appropriate, such as this and the preceding paragraphs) and drop the
  call to the \texttt{\textbackslash{}todo} command, so that its
  argument appears in black.

\section*{Feedback to the Teachers}

\todo{Write a paragraph, which will not be graded, describing your
  experience with this assignment.  You may also do so anonymously, by
  whichever channel you choose.  Which tasks were too difficult or too
  easy?  Which tasks were interesting or boring?  (Recall that
  experiments are inevitable.)  This will help us improve the course
  for the coming years.}
