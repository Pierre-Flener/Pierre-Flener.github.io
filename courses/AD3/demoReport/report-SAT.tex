\paragraph{Task~a: Ordered Resolution.}
Consider the following formula in conjunctive normal form (CNF):
\begin{multline*}
  \varphi \equiv (x_1 \lor x_2) \land
  (x_3 \lor x_4) \land
  (x_5 \lor x_6) \land
  (\neg x_1 \lor \neg x_3) \land
  (\neg x_1 \lor \neg x_5) \\ \land
  (\neg x_3 \lor \neg x_5) \land
  (\neg x_2 \lor \neg x_4) \land
  (\neg x_2 \lor \neg x_6) \land
  (\neg x_4 \lor \neg x_6)
\end{multline*}
\todo{Perform ordered resolution
  % (cf.\ \emph{Introduction to SAT}, slide~19)
  on this formula, selecting the variables in the order given by their
  index (i.e., $x_1$ before $x_2$ before~\dots).  Show the result
  after each iteration.
  % 
  Based on your resolution, is~$\varphi$ satisfiable?
}

\paragraph{Task~b: DPLL.}
Consider again the formula~$\varphi$ given in Task~a.
% 
\todo{Explain in detail how the DPLL algorithm,
  % (cf.\ \emph{Introduction to SAT}, slide~26),
  when applied to~$\varphi$, determines whether the formula is
  satisfiable.
  % 
  Assume that the variables are selected in the order given by their
  index (i.e., $x_1$ before $x_2$ before~\dots), and that they are
  assigned~$1$ (i.e., True) before they are assigned~$0$ (i.e.,
  False).
  % 
  Remember to perform unit propagation and to apply the pure-literal
  rule where possible, in order to prune parts of the search space.
}

\paragraph{Task~c: CDCL.}
Consider the following CNF formula:
\[
  (x_1 \lor x_8 \lor \neg x_2) \land
  (x_1 \lor \neg x_3) \land
  (x_2 \lor x_3 \lor x_4) \land
  (\neg x_4 \lor \neg x_5) \land
  (x_7 \lor \neg x_4 \lor \neg x_6) \land
  (x_5 \lor x_6)
\]
Assume that~$x_7$ has been assigned~$0$ at decision level~$2$, and
that~$x_8$ has been assigned~$0$ at decision level~$3$.
% 
Moreover, assume that the current decision assignment is $x_1 = 0$ at
decision level~$5$.
% 
\todo{Draw a resulting implication graph (possibly on paper or a
  whiteboard, and include it using the syntax for
  Figure~\ref{fig:wallStreet}).
  %% See \emph{Mini-tutorial on conflict-driven clause learning
  %% solvers}, slide~4.

  %   \label{fig:impGraph}
  % \end{figure}
  Does the graph contain any conflicts?  If so, then mark these
  clearly, and provide a conflict clause.
}

\paragraph{Task~d: Encoding.}~ \todo{Describe your encoding, citing
  either~\cite{AMK:CNF:Sinz}, or~\cite[Section~2.2.2]{CNFencodings},
  or both, if you use their ideas: first explain the meaning of the
  Boolean variables that you use in your formula~$\varphi_{d,c,e}$;
  then explain the encodings by the help functions
  % $\textsc{AndImply}(x_1,\dots,x_n,b)$ and
  % $\textsc{OrImply}(x_1,\dots,x_n,b)$
  of the hint that you actually use (there is no need to explain
  $\textsc{AtMost}(k,x_1,\dots,x_n)$ if you use~\cite{AMK:CNF:Sinz});
  and finally explain how the constraints of the problem are encoded
  using those variables and help functions.}

We chose the programming language \todo{\filler}, for which a compiler
or interpreter is available on the Linux computers of the IT
department.  All source code is \todo{uploaded} with this report (but
not listed inside it).  The compilation and running instructions are
\todo{\filler}.

We validated the correctness and speed of our encoding by
\todo{checking its outputs on 1,258 instances via the provided
  polynomial-time solution checker and by judging the runtime to be
  short}.

\paragraph{Task~e: Experiments.}
We chose the SAT solver \SolverSAT for our experiments.
%
We \todo{used or did not use} the provided script for running the
experiments and tabling their results
% specification of the ThinLinc machines of the IT department, or
% replace by a similar-looking specification of your own hardware:
\todo{under Linux Ubuntu~18.04 ($64$~bit) on an Intel Xeon E5520 of
  $2.27$~GHz, with $4$~processors of $4$~cores each, with a $70$~GB
  RAM and an $8$~MB L3 cache (a ThinLinc computer of the IT
  department)}.
% on the AD3 web interface to \MiniSat on a $2.69$~GHz Intel
% Core i7, with $8$~GB RAM and $4$~MB L3 cache.

The results are in Table~\ref{tab:res:sat}.
%
The trivially unsatisfiable instances (which are the ones that violate
the inequality $e \leq \Floor{\frac{d-1}{c-1}}$) that \todo{were
  actually attempted in our experiments} are
%% In other words: delete the ones that are NOT in YOUR table, and add
%% the missing ones that ARE in YOUR table:
$\Tuple{8,2,8}$, $\Tuple{10,2,10}$, $\Tuple{12,2,12}$,
$\Tuple{14,2,14}$, $\Tuple{16,2,16}$, $\Tuple{15,3,8}$,
\todo{\filler}, $\Tuple{16,4,6}$, \todo{\filler}, and \todo{\filler}.
%
We observe that our encoding detects their trivial unsatisfiability in
\todo{\filler} time.
