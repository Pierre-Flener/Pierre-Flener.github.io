Download *all* these files into the *same* folder,
make particular copies of demoReport.tex, report*.tex, and results*.tex

Ti-Aj.tex, where i is your team number and j is the assignment number),
and edit those copies by following the assignment instructions
in assignment?.pdf and by following the instructions given as
comments marked with %% within those .tex files.
