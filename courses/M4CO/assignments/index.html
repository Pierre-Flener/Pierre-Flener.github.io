<h1>Modelling for Combinatorial Optimisation (course 1DL451)</h1>

<p>(<a href="../course.html">back to the course homepage</a>)</p>

<h1>Assignments</h1>

<h2>Organisation</h2>

<p>There are 3 mandatory <strong>assignments</strong> (numbered 1 to 3
below, whose statements will appear in due time), worth 3
higher-education credits (ECTS credits) in total.  The main objective
of the assignments, which are to be done in <strong>teams</strong>, is
to exercise the theoretical knowledge gained in the lectures, on
carefully selected problems of our choice.  We are not just interested
in sufficiently correct and efficient models, but also in explanations
and experimental evaluations, hence a report is also required for each
assignment and its quality has an impact on the score.</p>

<p>For each assignment, the <a href="../contact.html">assistants</a>
supervise 3 <strong>help sessions</strong> for troubleshooting in the
preparation of your reports.  Assignment 1 is scored pass/fail in
order to get started gently, and each other assignment gets an
<strong>assignment score</strong> in \(0..5\).  An insufficiently good
report can be defended orally to an assistant in a scheduled
<strong>grading session</strong>.  Solutions and collective feedback
are given in a <strong>solution session</strong>.</p>

<p>PhD students do either the assignments (possibly in a duo team), or
just the <a href="../project.html">project</a> (solo; possibly in
connection with their PhD research; but they are highly encouraged to
do the assignments nevertheless), or both: contact the head
teacher.</p>

<h2>Help Sessions</h2>

<p>The objective of a help session is <em><strong>only</strong></em>
for the assistants to help you prepare an acceptable solution for the
assignment with the closest upcoming deadline.  The assignment
problems will normally be published at least a week prior to the first
help session.  Also, the necessary course material will normally have
been presented in lectures at least a week prior to the first help
session.  You are thus able and even <em><strong>strongly
encouraged</strong></em> to prepare your solution as far as possible
until the help sessions and to attend them, in order to make best use
of that reserved time span of personal attention by the
assistants.</p>

<p>Note that <em><strong>no</strong></em> further tutoring on lecture
topics, such as exercises whose solutions are given or to be handed in
at the end of the session, will be performed by the assistants at the
help sessions.</p>

<h2>Initial Grading</h2>

<p>The <strong>initial score</strong>, in the integer interval 0..5
(or pass/fail for Assignment 1), of your assignment report will
normally be determined by the late afternoon on the day before the
grading and solution sessions for that assignment.  Toward this, the
assistants run your model on a grading test suite and examine your
report.  An initial score is the <strong>final score</strong> if in
the set {0,3,4,5} (or pass for Assignment 1).</p>

<h2>Grading Session</h2>

<p>The objective of a grading session is to determine your
<strong>final score</strong> for the submitted report for the
assignment of the previous deadline.  Each team with an initial score
in the set {1,2} (or fail for Assignment 1) will normally be given an
appointment with an assistant during the scheduled grading session, in
a location of their choice, toward correcting
<em><strong>minor</em></strong> mistakes during that meeting and
possibly increasing your score by one unit.  An initial score of 1 (or
fail for Assignment 1) upon only <em><strong>major</em></strong>
mistakes cannot be increased at a grading session.</p>

<p>Appointment times are <em><strong>strict</strong></em>: the initial
score is final in case of a missed appointment.  Exceptions must be
negotiated in due time during work hours with the head teacher, upon
reporting a convincing case of force majeure.</p>

<h2>Solution Session</h2>

<p>The objective of a solution session is
<em><strong>only</strong></em> to give collective feedback and discuss
acceptable solutions to the assignment of the previous deadline.
<em><strong>No</strong></em> models will be handed out.  The first two
solution sessions are merged with the initial help sessions to the
next assignment.</p>

<p>Some comments on your submitted report can be found at Studium;
more detailed individual feedback can be obtained orally from the
assistants upon appointment.</p>

<p>Note that <em><strong>no</strong></em> further tutoring on lecture
topics, such as exercises whose solutions are given or to be handed in
at the end of the session, will be performed by the assistants at the
solution sessions.</p>

<h2>Submission and Deadlines</h2>

<p>All assignment reports must follow the assignment-specific imposed
structure (also see the <a href="../report/demoReport.pdf">demo
report</a> and some of its LaTeX <a
href="https://github.com/Pierre-Flener/Pierre-Flener.github.io/tree/main/courses/M4CO/report">source</a>)
and must be submitted electronically via Studium, whose clock may be
different from yours.  Submission deadlines are
<em><strong>hard</strong></em>.  Exceptions must be negotiated in due
time during work hours with the head teacher, upon reporting a
convincing case of force majeure.  Grading will only start after a
deadline, so you can submit multiple times until then.</p>

<h2 id="Teams">Teams</h2>

<p>For pedagogic and resource reasons, every assignment report and
project deliverable <em><strong>must</strong></em> be prepared by a
team of 2 students, both being first-time students or both being
non-first-time students of this course.  <em><strong>No</strong></em>
permission will ever be granted for teams of three or more
students.</p>

<p>Until 23:59 of Sun 9 Nov 2025, you can declare a team at Studium:
both teammates must consent to forming a team.  If you are not
formally registered yet, then you can declare your team by email to
the M4CO helpdesk by that hard deadline.  You are <em><strong>strongly
encouraged</strong></em> to advertise your search for a teammate at a
course event or by using the Teammate Search discussion at Studium.
If you are however fine with a <em><strong>randomly</strong></em>
assigned teammate, then declare this by email to the M4CO helpdesk by
that hard deadline: you might not get any teammate, because you are
the odd one out or because the assigned one drops the course on short
notice, so <em><strong>start working solo</strong></em> on Assignment
1 in order to guard against this possibility.  All students who have
done neither of those actions by that hard deadline will be considered
to have dropped the course, but will not be unregistered by us: their
submitted deliverables will normally not be graded.</p>

<p>Teams may change between assignments: permission will be granted,
as long as you inform the M4CO helpdesk in advance and the total
number of teams does not increase.</p>

<p>Only <em><strong>one</strong></em> teammate of each team should
submit each assignment report or project deliverable.</p>

<p>Exceptions for solo work must be negotiated in due time, during
work hours, with the head teacher, upon reporting a convincing case of
force majeure.  The assignments are calibrated somewhat smaller for
those students.  Such an exception is only valid for the assignment(s)
it was negotiated for.</p>

<h2 id="ethics">Ethics</h2>

<p>The <a
href="https://www.uu.se/en/staff/organisation-and-governance/regulations/routine-for-dealing-with-suspected-deceptive-conduct-in-examinations">legislation
on plagiarism and cheating</a> (<a
href="../../../ethics.html">summary</a>) of Uppsala University will be
rigorously applied, without exceptions.  This disallows using a public
repository (such as GitHub, where you should use a <a
href="https://education.github.com/pack">free private student
repository</a>) for code management within your team.  We reserve the
right to use plagiarism detection tools and point out that they are
extremely powerful.</p>

<p><em><strong>When submitting you implicitly certify that your report
and all its uploaded attachments were produced solely by your team,
except where explicitly stated otherwise and clearly referenced, that
each teammate can individually explain any part starting from the
moment of submitting your report, and that your report and attachments
are not freely accessible on a public repository.</strong></em></p>

<p>We reserve the right to give different assignment scores to the
teammates of a team, depending on the performance at the grading
session.</p>

<p>Please report any problems within a team to the head teacher, who
will handle the case in confidence, in the best interest of both
teammates, keeping the ethics dimension in mind.</p>

<h2>Expected Effort</h2>

<p>One higher-education credit (ECTS credit) translates under Swedish
university law into an expected 26.67 hours of work for the average
student.</p>

<p>The assignments are worth 3 credits: discounting about half of the
21 hours spent on the lectures (the other half being similarly
discounted on the 2 project credits), <em><strong>the assignments are
calibrated to take about 21 hours of work on average by the average
student, for each teammate</strong></em>, including the help, grading,
and solution sessions.</p>

<p>All this does not clash with other courses you are taking, as
university studies are legally defined to take 400 hours of work per
study period (normally 10 weeks), and the standard 15 credits targeted
in a study period are calibrated to reach that total.</p>

<h2>Assignment Grade</h2>

<p>The <strong>assignment grade</strong> is determined by a <a
href="../grades.html#p1a">published scale</a>, depending on the
assignment scores.</p>

<h2>Need Help?</h2>

<p>See <a href="../contact.html">Contact, Help, and FAQ</a>.</p>

<h2>Overall Grade</h2>

<p>The <strong>overall grade</strong> is determined by a <a
href="../grades.html#p1o">published scale</a>, depending on the
assignment scores and the project score.</p>

<h2>Contract</h2>

<p>These rules are effective as of Mon 3 Nov 2025.  The head teacher
reserves the right to modify them at any moment, should special
circumstances call for this.</p>
