<h1>Modelling for Combinatorial Optimisation (course 1DL451) <br> & <br>
Combinatorial Optimisation and Constraint Programming (course 1DL442)</h1>

<p>(<a href="course.html">back to the course homepage</a>)</p>

<h1>Project</h1>

<h2>Organisation</h2>

<p>The project is to be done in teams (<a
href="assignments/index.html#Teams">team-building instructions</a>)
and is worth 2 higher-education credits (ECTS credits).  The main
objective of the project is to exercise further the theoretical
knowledge gained in the lectures, but on a problem that you propose
and that gets our approval.</p>

<p>We are not just interested in a sufficiently complete and efficient
approach, but also in explanations and experimental evaluation, hence
a <strong>report</strong> is also required for the project and the
quality of the report determines the project score.</p>

<p>Seven <strong>help sessions</strong> are scheduled for the project.</p>

<p>PhD students do either the <a href="assignments">assignments</a>
(solo), or just the project (solo; possibly in connection with their
PhD research; but they are highly encouraged to do the <a
href="assignments">assignments</a> nevertheless), or both: contact the
head teacher.</p>

<h2>Project Proposal</h2>

<p>A <strong>project proposal</strong> of three problems, listed by
decreasing preference, each answering two questions (what? which
third-party instance data?) must be submitted at Studium (as a single
file in .pdf format; all other formats will be rejected; state the
team number and the names of the team members): the head teacher may
interactively (via Studium) negotiate revisions with you during the
subsequent seven days until our <strong>notification</strong> (if
approved, then <em>pass</em>, else <em>fail</em>).  The problems can
be your own or drawn from the following websites (in the latter case,
it suffices to name the problem when listing it):</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/coding-competitions.appspot.com/HC/2017/hashcode2017_qualification_task.pdf">Streaming Videos</a> (<a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/coding-competitions.appspot.com/HC/2017/qualification_round_2017.in.zip">data</a>), a problem of the former Google Hash Code competition</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.csplib.org">CSPlib</a>: <em>only</em>
  consider problems 11 (<a href="https://fado.dcc.fc.up.pt">FAdo</a>
  might be useful here),
  40, 51, 62, 63 (solo teams only), 69, 82, and 131</li>
  <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.00585">Business Dinner</a> (ignore everything about Howell designs)</li>
  <li><a href="https://norvig.com/carcassonne.html">Carcassonne</a>
  (use the <a href="https://github.com/amirbaghi/cocp-carcassonne-project-post-processing">post-processing</a> by two teams of autumn 2022)</li>
</ul>
<p>Let us know if you think some problem ought to be taken off this
list, for instance because an approach with MiniZinc or OPL can be
found on the internet.</p>

<h2>Project Rules and Grading Criteria</h2>

<p>An approved project proposal entitles to continuation (deadlines
and schedule in the table below):</p>

<ul>
  
  <li>

  <p><strong>Initial report</strong>: If your initial report is
  submitted on time at Studium, follows the <a
  href="report/project-report.pdf">imposed structure</a> of the
  project report (LaTeX <a href="https://github.com/Pierre-Flener/Pierre-Flener.github.io/tree/main/courses/M4CO/report">source</a>,
  including a <a href="report/demoReport.pdf">demo report</a>), and
  complies with the instructions at the <a
  href="slides/T01-Introduction.pdf#page=88">slides numbered 79 and 80
  of Topic 1<a>, then you <em>pass</em> and are entitled to a final
  report, else you <em>fail</em> and are not entitled to a final
  report.  Either way, you get feedback.</p>

  <p>Note that the project report has additional structure compared to
  assignment reports, namely <strong>Approach</strong> and
  <strong>Correctness</strong>.</p>

  </li>

  <li><p><strong>Final report</strong>: You must use the obtained
  feedback in order to prepare your final report: it will get a score
  \(p \in 0..10\), under the same conditions as the initial report,
  and it must be rewritten where relevant and not just expanded
  incrementally.</p></li>

</ul>

<h2>Submission and Deadlines</h2>

<p>The project proposal, initial report, and final report must be
submitted electronically via Studium, whose clock may be different
from yours.  Submission deadlines are <em><strong>hard</strong></em>.
Exceptions must be negotiated in due time during work hours with the
head teacher, upon reporting a convincing case of force majeure.
Grading will only start after a deadline, so you can submit multiple
times until then.</p>

<h2>Ethics</h2>

<p>The <a href="assignments/index.html#ethics">considerations on
ethics of the assignment reports</a> also apply to the project
report.</p>

<p>We reserve the right to give different project scores to the
teammates of a team.</p>

<h2>Expected Effort</h2>

<p>Each higher-education credit (ECTS credit) translates under Swedish
university law into an expected 26.67 hours of work for the average
student.  The project is worth 2 credits: discounting about half of
the 21 hours spent in period 1 on the lectures (the other half being
similarly discounted on the 3 assignment credits), <em><strong>the
project should reflect 49.5 hours of work by the average student, for
each teammate</strong></em>.  This does not clash with other courses
you are taking, as university studies are legally defined to take 400
hours of work per study period (normally 10 weeks), and the standard
15 credits targeted in a study period are calibrated to reach that
total.</p>

<h2>Project Grade</h2>

<p>The <strong>project grade</strong> is determined by a <a
href="grades.html#p1p">published scale</a>, depending on your project
score \(p \in 0..10\).</p>

<h2>Need Help?</h2>

<p>See <a href="contact.html">Contact, Help, and FAQ</a>.</p>

<h2>Overall Grade</h2>

<p>The <strong>overall grade</strong> is determined by a <a
href="grades.html#p1o">published scale</a>, depending on the modelling
assignment scores and the project score \(p\).</p>

<h2>Contract</h2>

<p>These rules are effective as of Mon 3 Nov 2025.  The head teacher
reserves the right to modify them at any moment, should special
circumstances call for this.</p>
