Changes to the API of MiniCP:
- since the paper "MiniCP: A Lightweight Solver for Constraint Programming" (at https://doi.org/10.1007/s12532-020-00190-7 and a pre-print at https://minicp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_static/mini-cp.pdf) was published;
- since the Keynote slides uploaded at http://minicp.org were made; and
- since the corresponding videos at YouTube (linked to from http://minicp.org) were filmed.

Listing 4 p145:
IntVar: isBound --> isFixed
IntVar: assign --> fix
IntVar: propagateOnBind --> propagateOnFix
Listing 7 p147:
IntDomain: isBound --> isSingleton
Listing 8 p147:
DomainListener: bind --> fix
Listing 10 p148:
SparseSetDomain: isBound --> isSingleton
Listing 11 p151:
IntVarImpl: onBind --> onFix
IntVarImpl: onBounds --> onBound
IntVarImpl: bind --> fix
IntVarImpl: isBound --> isFixed
IntVarImpl: assign --> fix
IntVarImpl: propagateOnBind --> propagateOnFix
Listing 29 p165:
IntVarViewOffset: isBound --> isFixed
IntVarViewOffset: assign --> fix
IntVarViewOffset: propagateOnBind --> propagateOnFix
Listing 30 p166:
whenBind --> whenFix

Errata in the paper:
p145, Listing 4: the methods "whenFix" (used as "whenBind" in
                 the example in Listing 30 at page 166), "whenBoundChange"
                 (was "whenBoundsChange" before the API change),
                 and "whenDomainChange" of IntVar are missing
p148, last line: U --> U-1
p151, Listing 11, line 42: propagateOnBounds --> propagateOnBoundChange
p151, Listing 11: same for IntVarImpl as for IntVar at p145, Listing 4
p154, Listing 15, line 25: insert "public" and indent
p165, Listing 29, line 24: propagateOnBounds -(twice)-> propagateOnBoundChange
