This folder has the slides of the courses "Modelling for Combinatorial Optimisation [M4CO]" (5 ECTS credits, code 1DL451) and "Combinatorial Optimisation and Constraint Programming [COCP]" (10 ECTS credits, code 1DL442) by Prof. Pierre Flener at Uppsala University in Sweden.  The courses (and their predecessors) have been given every autumn semester, since 2003.  The COCP course was given for the last time in 2024.

The M4CO course comprises the first 11 topics of this folder (T01 to T11), although T09 to T11 are incomplete and have not been taught or evolved for several years.  We use the MiniZinc language and toolchain (https://www.minizinc.org) in order to model various problems and run the models under solvers of various technologies, namely CP, SAT, MIP, local search, as well as hybrids (such as LCG) and portfolios thereof.

The COCP course had two halves.  The first half was the M4CO course.  The second half was from 2021 to 2024 based on -- and contributed to -- the MiniCP teaching project (http://www.minicp.org), with my files T12-CP-MiniCP and T18-Conclusion added to the material of that site.  From 2007 to 2020, the second half comprised the last 7 topics (T12 to T18): we studied the algorithms for a solver of constraint programming (CP) technology and used the Gecode C++ library (https://www.gecode.org) for the assignments.  All those slides are no longer maintained, but are left here for archival purposes.

If you are an instructor and would like to use the LaTeX source of these slides, then contact me (https://pierre-flener.github.io); under additional conditions, I can also give you the source code of assignment questions.
