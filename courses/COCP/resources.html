<h1>Modelling for Combinatorial Optimisation (course 1DL451) <br> & <br>
Combinatorial Optimisation and Constraint Programming (course 1DL442)</h1>

<p>(<a href="course.html">back to the course homepage</a>)</p>

<h1>Resources</h1>

<h2>MiniZinc</h2>

<p>In Course 1DL451 and Part 1 of Course 1DL442, we use the <a
href="https://www.minizinc.org">MiniZinc</a> modelling language and
toolchain (free; open-source):</p>

<h3>MiniZinc: Local Resources</h2>

<ul>
  
  <li><p>The MiniZinc toolchain and all backends that must be used in
  this course are installed on the <a
  href="https://www.it.uu.se/datordrift/maskinpark/linux">ThinLinc
  Linux hosts of the IT department</a>: this is explained in our <a
  href="assignments/warmup-MiniZinc.pdf">warm-up for
  MiniZinc</a></p></li>

  <li><p>We have prepared some <a
  href="https://github.com/Pierre-Flener/Pierre-Flener.github.io/tree/main/courses/COCP/assignments/exercises">exercises on comprehensions</a> (no
  hand-in!) and strongly recommend you do them as soon as possible
  after the second lecture; <a
  href="assignments/exercises/comprehensions-solutions.pdf">solutions</a>
  will appear in due time <!-- (published on Mon 5 Sep) -->
  </p></li>

  <li><p>For the assignments, you <em><strong>must</strong></em> use
  our experiment script described in our <a
  href="assignments/cheatsheet.pdf">MiniZinc Cheatsheet</a>: read this
  document after the warm-up session!</p></li>

  <li><p>For your project (but <em><strong>not</strong></em> the
  assignments), consider using <a
  href="https://minizinc-python.readthedocs.io">MiniZinc Python</a>, a
  native Python interface for the MiniZinc toolchain, so that an
  approach with any combination of pre-processing, running MiniZinc,
  possibly on a pipeline of multiple models, and post-processing fits
  into a standalone code (but at the cost of not being able to use the
  experiment script of the previous item): see <a
  href="demoReport/mzn-python-demo.zip">our instructions for a toy
  model</a></p></li>

  <li><p>Our <a href="contact.html">Contact, Help, Ethics, and FAQ</a>
  page lists resources where you can get help on MiniZinc, provided
  ethics guidelines are followed</p></li>

  <li><p>We unfortunately have <em><strong>no</strong></em> resources
  to provide any support for installing the MiniZinc toolchain or
  backends on your own computer</li>

</ul>

<h3>MiniZinc: Public Resources</h3>

<ul>

  <li><p>The <a
  href="https://www.minizinc.org/doc-latest/index-en.html">MiniZinc
  Handbook</a> includes installation instructions (in case you want to
  install on your own computer some of the backends we use in this
  course), a tutorial, the User Manual, and the Reference
  Manual</p></li>

  <li><p>Try the nice MiniZinc IDE (Integrated Development
  Environment) (the free <a
  href="https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono">JetBrains Mono</a> font
  makes the maths and logic operators look nice)</p></li>

  <li><p><a href="https://python.minizinc.dev">MiniZinc Python</a> is
  a native Python interface for the MiniZinc toolchain</p></li>
  
  <li><p>The MiniZinc models of the <a
  href="https://github.com/MiniZinc/minizinc-benchmarks">MiniZinc
  Benchmarks</a> and the annual <a
  href="https://github.com/MiniZinc/mzn-challenge">MiniZinc
  Challenge</a> are published</p></li>

  <li><p>The MiniZinc Team moderates a <a
  href="https://groups.google.com/g/minizinc">MiniZinc Discussion
  Group</a>; do <em><strong>not</strong></em> ask for advice on
  modelling in general, or on how to solve an assignment</p></li>
  
  <li><p>There are questions tagged with MiniZinc at <a
  href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/minizinc">Stack
  Overflow</a>; do <em><strong>not</strong></em> ask for advice on how
  to solve an assignment</p></li>

   <li><p>To report an issue to the MiniZinc Team, follow the relevant
  link at <a
  href="https://www.minizinc.org/downloads">Downloads</a></p></li>

  <li><p>The Coursera on-line courses <a
  href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/basic-modeling">Basic Modeling
  for Discrete Optimization</a> and <a
  href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/advanced-modeling">Advanced
  Modeling for Discrete Optimization</a> are also based on MiniZinc,
  but have a less pronounced model-once-solve-everywhere focus than
  this course; see the <a
  href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc3cBvtrem0">advertisement</a>
  for these courses on YouTube</p></li>

  <li id="automata"><p>The <a href="https://fado.dcc.fc.up.pt">FAdo</a>
  toolkit has many algorithms (including conversion and minimisation)
  for working with a regular expression, NFA, or DFA</p></li>

  <li><p>Another <a
  href="https://cyberzhg.github.io/toolbox">toolbox</a> has converters
  (not checked by the instructors) for transforming a regular
  expression into an NFA or (minimised) DFA</p></li>

</ul>

<h2>LaTeX and Demo Report <!-- &amp; Slides --></h2>

<p>We highly recommend you learn or use LaTeX for typesetting your
assignment &amp; project reports
<!-- and project slides -->
in a professional way, but this is optional.  The learning of LaTeX is
<em><strong>outside</strong></em> your time budget for these courses,
but very well-invested as you will find out during these courses or
later.  Here are some LaTeX resources:</p>

<ul>

  <li><p>See our <a href="assignments/warmup-LaTeX.pdf">warm-up for
  LaTeX</a></p></li>
  
  <li><p><a href="demoReport/demo-M4CO.pdf">Demo report M4CO</a>
  <!-- and <a href="demoReport/demo-CP.pdf">demo report CP</a> -->
  (LaTeX <a href="demoReport/demoReport.zip">source</a>),
  which also contains examples of all LaTeX commands you need for
  these courses; from the command line (or with Emacs/Aquamacs),
  compile with <code>pdflatex</code> (once or twice, depending on
  whether cross-references need to be recomputed), and run
  <code>bibtex</code> whenever the bibliography was modified</p></li>

<!-- dropped from ht23 on:
  <li><p><a href="demoSlides/demoSlides.pdf">Demo slides M4CO</a>
  (LaTeX <a href="demoSlides">source</a>)</p></li>
-->
  
  <li><p><a href="https://www.latex-project.org">LaTeX</a></p></li>

  <li><p><a
  href="https://tug.ctan.org/info/lshort/english/lshort.pdf">The (Not
  So) Short Introduction to LaTeX2e</a></p></li>
  
  <li><p><a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX">The LaTeX
  wikibook</a>: a gentle but thorough introduction</p></li>
  
  <li><p>Don't know the LaTeX code for that mathematical symbol you
  need? Draw it by hand at <a
  href="https://detexify.kirelabs.org/classify.html">Detexify</a>, and
  the applet will find the code for you</p></li>
  
  <li><p>Recommended text editors: <a
  href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a>, <a
  href="https://aquamacs.org/">Aquamacs</a>, and share-editing via <a
  href="https://www.overleaf.com">Overleaf</a>; we strongly recommend
  <em><strong>not</strong></em> to use WYSIWYG editors for LaTeX like
  LyX</p></li>

</ul>

<h2>MiniCP</h2>

<p>In Part 2 of Course 1DL442, we use <a
href="http://www.minicp.org">MiniCP</a>, a white-box bottom-up
teaching framework for CP implemented in Java (free; open-source):</p>

<ul>

  <li><p>We have prepared some <a
  href="https://user.it.uu.se/~frekn832/courses/COCP/assignments/warmup">exercises
  on lambda expressions</a> (no hand-in!) and strongly recommend you
  do them as soon as possible after the first lecture on MiniCP;
  solutions will appear there in due time</p></li>

  <li><p>Other than at the warm-up and help sessions, and only time
  permitting, we unfortunately have <em><strong>no</strong></em>
  resources to provide any support for installing MiniCP and a
  suitable IDE (we recommend <a
  href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">IntelliJ</a>) on your own
  computer</p></li>

</ul>

<!--
<h2>Constraint Programming (CP)</h2>

<p>Our <a
href="https://www.it.uu.se/research/group/optimisation">Optimisation</a>
research group has a rather comprehensive <a
href="https://www.it.uu.se/research/group/optimisation/resources/constraint">list
of blogs, archives &amp; libraries, associations, books, conferences
&amp; workshops, courses &amp; tutorials, journals, solvers &amp;
languages / libraries, etc</a> on constraint programming.</p>
-->

<!--
<h2>Gecode</h2>

<p>In Part 2 of Course 1DL442, we use <a
href="https://www.gecode.org">Gecode</a>, a C++ finite-domain CP
library (version 6.2.0; free; open-source):</p>

<ul>

  <li><p>You can use Gecode on any Linux computer of the IT
  department</p></li>

  <li><p><a href="https://www.gecode.org/download.html">Download Gecode
  to your own computer</a>:</p>

  <ul>

    <li><p>Preferably use the pre-compiled binaries (available for
    Linux/x86, macOS, and Windows)</p></li>

    <li><p>We unfortunately have <em><strong>no</strong></em>
    resources to provide any support for installing Gecode on your own
    computer</p></li>

  </ul>

  </li>

  <li><p><a href="https://www.gecode.org/doc-latest/MPG.pdf">How to
  program, compile, link, and execute a Gecode model</a>:
  <em><strong>you should read the recommended chapters (at <a
  href="lectures.html">Lectures, Slides, and Literature</a>) of this
  document as soon as possible!!!</strong></em></p></li>

  <li><p>You can use and adapt our <a
  href="assignments/assignment4/makefiles">makefiles</a> for compiling
  the <code>queens.cpp</code> file of Assignment 4</p></li>

  <li><p>Our <a href="contact.html">Contact, Help, Ethics, and FAQ</a>
  page lists resources where you can get help on Gecode, provided
  ethics guidelines are followed</p></li>
