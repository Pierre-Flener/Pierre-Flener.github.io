<!--
<p><strong>2020-11-27: Assignment 6</strong> is <a
href="assignments/index.html">published</a>.  All the necessary
material (Topic 15 for Question 1, and Topic 17 for Question 2) has
already been taught.  Note also that the <tt>gather_stats.py</tt> script
has been updated.</p>
-->

<!--
<p><strong>2020-11-16: Guest lecture.</strong> Remember that the guest
lecture from industry tomorrow Tue 17 Nov at 10:15 is mandatory: see
<a href="lectures.html">lectures</a>.</p>
-->

<!--
<p><strong>2020-11-16: Mid-period course evaluation.</strong> The
second informal, anonymous, intermediate evaluation of the course is
conducted at the Student Portal from 11:50 until 23:59 today: feedback
is very welcome!</p>
-->

<!--
<p><strong>2020-11-06: Assignment 5</strong> is <a
href="assignments/index.html">published</a>.  All the necessary
material (Topics 12 to 14) has already been taught, and Topic 16 has a
lot of inspiring material.</p>
-->

<!--
<p><strong>2020-10-26: Assignment 4</strong> is <a
href="assignments/index.html">published</a>.  All the necessary
material for Question 3 (Topics 12 to 15) will normally have been
taught until Mon 9 Nov 2020 inclusive, but you should get started
right away by tackling Questions 1 and 2 while reading the recommended
chapters of the Gecode documentation.</p>
-->

<!--
<p><strong>2020-10-22: Welcome back!</strong> Until 23:59 of Sun 1 Nov
2020, you may build a new team of two students by sending an email to
the head teacher: both teammates must consent to forming a team.
There is no need for an email if there is no change.  You are
<em><strong>strongly encouraged</strong></em> to advertise your search
for a teammate at a course event or using the Teammate Search option
of the FORUM menu item at the Student Portal.  If you are however fine
with a randomly assigned teammate, then declare this by email to the
head teacher by that hard deadline: you might not get any teammate,
because you are the odd one out, so <em><strong>start working
solo</strong></em> on Assignment 4 in order to guard against this
possibility.  No permission will ever be granted for teams of three or
more students.  Exceptions for solo work must be negotiated in due
time with the head teacher, during working hours, upon reporting a
convincing case of force majeure.</p>
-->

<!--
<p><strong>2019-09-26: Presentation timetable.</strong> The timetable
of the project presentations is <a href="project.html">published</a>,
violating none of the (possibly empty) lists of collisions declared by
email.</p>
-->

<!--
<p><strong>2020-09-18: Assignment 3</strong> is <a
href="assignments/index.html">published</a>.  All the necessary
material (Topics 1 to 8) will normally have been taught until Wed 23
Sep 2020 inclusive, but you can start already now.  We strongly
recommend you get started early and attend help sessions.</p>
-->

<!--
<p><strong>2020-09-09: In Practice.</strong> Watch <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7IhtuB89SY">Optimisation in
Practice</a>, by a practitioner, for how to consult to industry on
optimisation.</p>
-->

<!--
<p><strong>2020-09-03: Exercises:</strong> Solutions to the exercises
on array comprehensions are now <a href="http://user.it.uu.se/~gusbj192/courses/M4CO/exercises">published</a>.</p>
-->

<!--
<p><strong>2020-09-01: Assignment 2</strong> is <a
href="assignments/index.html">published</a>.  All the necessary
material (Topics 1 to 4) will normally have been taught until Wed 9
Sep 2020 inclusive.  We strongly recommend you get started early and
attend help sessions.  Note that the Grading Rules are harder from now
on: correctness is now a requirement.</p>
-->

<!--
<p><strong>2020-08-31: Assignment 1</strong> is <a
href="assignments/index.html">published</a>.  All the necessary
material (Topics 1 to 2) will normally have been taught until Wed 2
Sep 2020 inclusive.  We strongly recommend you get started early and
attend help sessions.</p>

<!--
<p><strong>2020-08-28: Zoom links.</strong> The Zoom links for all
events are at the Student Portal for courses 1DL441 and 1DL451 under
the LOGISTICS FOR ONLINE TEACHING menu item.  Send an email to the
main teacher (lectures) or teaching assistant (other events) in case
you are not quite registered yet and cannot see these links.</p>

<p><strong>2021-08-09: COVID19 contingency plan.</strong> If we
suddenly must switch to off-campus teaching, then all events will be
run via Zoom instead of in rooms.</p>

<p><strong>2021-08-09: Mandatory events.</strong> Attendance at the
scheduled events in the afternoons of Wed 13 Oct 2021 and Thu 14 Oct
2021 is <em><strong>mandatory</strong></em>, and so is
<!-- are the guest lecture in the middle of September (date to be
determined) and --> the guest lecture (for part 2 of Course 1DL441)
from industry on Mon 22 Nov 2021:
<!-- (to be announced): -->
each missed such event (in case of no force majeure) can be
compensated for by writing a two-page summary of a research paper
chosen by the head teacher.</p>

<!--

<p><strong>2021-08-xx: Welcome aboard!</strong> Until 23:59 of Sun 5
Sep 2021, you can declare a team of two students by TBA at Studium:
both teammates must consent to forming a team.  If you are not
formally registered yet, or if your team is the union of two
one-person teams in each of the two courses, then you can declare your
team by email to the relevant <a href="contact.html">main
assistant</a> by that hard deadline.  You are <em><strong>strongly
encouraged</strong></em> to advertise your search for a teammate at a
course event or by TBA at Studium.  If you are however fine with a
randomly assigned teammate, then declare this by email to the relevant
main assistant by that hard deadline: you might not get any teammate,
because you are the odd one out or because the assigned one drops the
course on short notice, so <em><strong>start working
solo</strong></em> on Assignment 1 in order to guard against this
possibility.  All students who have done neither of those actions by
that hard deadline will be considered to have dropped the course, but
will not be unregistered by us: their submitted deliverables will
normally not be graded.  No permission will ever be granted for teams
of three or more students.  Exceptions for solo work must be
negotiated in due time with the head teacher, during working hours,
upon reporting a convincing case of force majeure.</p>
