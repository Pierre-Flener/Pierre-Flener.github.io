<h1>Modelling for Combinatorial Optimisation (course 1DL451) <br> & <br>
Combinatorial Optimisation and Constraint Programming (course 1DL442)</h1>

<p>(<a href="../course.html">back to the course homepage</a>)</p>

<h1>Assignments</h1>

<h2>Organisation</h2>

<p>For Course 1DL451 and Part 1 of Course 1DL442 (in period 1), there
are 3 mandatory <strong>modelling assignments</strong> (numbered 1 to
3 below, whose statements will appear in due time), worth 3
higher-education credits (ECTS credits) in total.  For Part 2 of
Course 1DL442 (in period 2), there are 3 mandatory <strong>programming
assignments</strong> (numbered 4 to 6 below, whose statements will
appear in due time), worth 5 higher-education credits (ECTS credits)
in total.  The main objective of the assignments, which are to be done
in <strong>teams</strong>, is to exercise the theoretical knowledge
gained in the lectures, on carefully selected problems of our choice.
We are not just interested in sufficiently correct and efficient
models or programs, but also in explanations and experimental
evaluations, hence a report is also required for each assignment and
its quality has an impact on the assignment score.</p>

<p>For each assignment, the <a href="../contact.html">assistants</a>
supervise 3 <strong>help sessions</strong> for troubleshooting in the
preparation of your reports.  Assignments 1 and 4 are scored pass/fail
in order to get started gently on each part of the course, and each
other assignment gets an <strong>assignment score</strong> in
\(0..5\).  An insufficiently good report in part 1 of the course can
be defended orally to an assistant in a scheduled <strong>grading
session</strong>.  Solutions and collective feedback are given by an
assistant in a <strong>solution session</strong>.</p>

<p>PhD students do either the assignments (possibly in a duo team), or
just the <a href="../project">project</a> (solo; possibly in
connection with their PhD research; but they are highly encouraged to
do the assignments nevertheless), or both: contact the head
teacher.</p>

<!-- THIS IS A LONG TIME AGO NOW:
<p>Students who took the old local course "Combinatorial Optimisation
with Constraint Programming" (until autumn 2017 also with code 1DL442,
formerly 1DL023, 1DL118, and 1DL440), or an equivalent course
elsewhere, are encouraged to study in advance the slides of <a
href="../slides/T08-InferenceSearchCP.pdf">Topic 8: Inference & Search
in CP & LCG</a> (also see Sections 2.5 and 4.2.1 in the <a
href="https://www.minizinc.org/doc-latest/index-en.html">MiniZinc
Handbook</a>), so as to use annotations for CP/LCG inference and
CP/LCG search in all assignments, due to the slight overlap with such
a course.</p>
-->

<h2>Help Sessions</h2>

<p>The objective of a help session is <em><strong>only</strong></em>
for the assistants to help you prepare an acceptable solution for the
assignment with the closest upcoming deadline.  The assignment
problems will normally be published at least a week prior to the first
help session.  Also, the necessary course material will normally have
been presented in lectures at least a week prior to the first help
session.  You are thus able and even <em><strong>strongly
encouraged</strong></em> to prepare your solution as far as possible
until the help sessions and to attend them, in order to make best use
of that reserved time span of personal attention by the
assistants.</p>

<p>Note that <em><strong>no</strong></em> further tutoring on lecture
topics, such as exercises whose solutions are given or to be handed in
at the end of the session, will be performed by the assistants at the
help sessions.</p>

<h2>Initial Grading</h2>

<p>The <strong>initial score</strong>, in the integer interval 0..5
(or pass/fail for Assignments 1 and 4), of your assignment report will
normally be determined by the late afternoon on the day before the
grading and solution sessions for that assignment.  Toward this, the
assistants run your code on a grading test suite and examine your
report.  An initial score is the <strong>final score</strong> if in
the set {0,3,4,5} (or pass for Assignments 1 and 4).</p>

<h2>Grading Session</h2>

<p>The objective of a grading session is to determine your
<strong>final score</strong> for the submitted report for the
assignment of the previous deadline.  Each team with an initial score
in the set {1,2} (or fail for Assignment 1) will normally be given an
appointment with an assistant during the scheduled grading session, in
a location of her/his choice, toward correcting
<em><strong>minor</em></strong> mistakes during that meeting and
possibly increasing your score by one unit.  An initial score of 1 (or
fail for Assignment 1) upon only <em><strong>major</em></strong>
mistakes cannot be increased at a grading session.</p>

<p>Appointment times are <em><strong>strict</strong></em>: the initial
score is final in case of a missed appointment.  Exceptions must be
negotiated in due time during work hours with the head teacher, upon
reporting a convincing case of force majeure.</p>

<h2>Solution Session</h2>

<p>The objective of a solution session is
<em><strong>only</strong></em> for an assistant to give collective
feedback and discuss acceptable solutions to the assignment of the
previous deadline.  <em><strong>No</strong></em> code will be handed
out.  The first five solution sessions are merged with the initial
help sessions to the next assignment.</p>

<p>Some comments on your submitted report can be found at Studium;
more detailed individual feedback can be obtained orally from the
assistants upon appointment.</p>

<p>Note that <em><strong>no</strong></em> further tutoring on lecture
topics, such as exercises whose solutions are given or to be handed in
at the end of the session, will be performed by the assistants at the
solution sessions.</p>

<h2>Submission and Deadlines</h2>

<p>All assignment reports, with <a
href="../demoReport/demo-M4CO.pdf">imposed M4CO structure</a>
<!--
and <a href="../demoReport/demo-CP.pdf">imposed CP structure</a>
-->
(LaTeX <a href="../demoReport/demoReport.zip">source</a>),
but no imposed CP structure,
<!-- -->
must be submitted electronically via Studium, whose clock may be
different from yours.  Submission deadlines are
<em><strong>hard</strong></em>. Exceptions must be negotiated in due
time during work hours with the head teacher, upon reporting a
convincing case of force majeure. Grading will only start after a
deadline, so you can submit multiple times until then.</p>

<h2 id="Teams">Teams</h2>

<p>For pedagogic and resource reasons, every assignment report and
project deliverable <em><strong>must</strong></em> be prepared by a
team of 2 students, both being first-time students or both being
non-first-time students of this course.  <em><strong>No</strong></em>
permission will ever be granted for teams of three or more
students.</p>

<p>Until 23:59 of Sun 8 Sep 2024, you can declare a team at Studium:
both teammates must consent to forming a team.  If you are not
formally registered yet, or if your team is the union of two
one-person teams in each of the two courses, then you can declare your
team by email to the COCP helpdesk by that hard deadline.  You are
<em><strong>strongly encouraged</strong></em> to advertise your search
for a teammate at a course event or by using the Teammate Search
discussion at Studium.  If you are however fine with a
<em><strong>randomly</strong></em> assigned teammate, then declare
this by email to the COCP helpdesk by that hard deadline: you might
not get any teammate, because you are the odd one out or because the
assigned one drops the course on short notice, so <em><strong>start
working solo</strong></em> on Assignment 1 in order to guard against
this possibility.  All students who have done neither of those actions
by that hard deadline will be considered to have dropped the course,
but will not be unregistered by us: their submitted deliverables will
normally not be graded.</p>

<p>Teams may change between assignments: permission will be granted,
as long as you inform the COCP helpdesk in advance and the total
number of teams does not increase.</p>

<p>Only <em><strong>one</strong></em> teammate of each team should
submit each assignment report or project deliverable.</p>

<p>Exceptions for solo work must be negotiated in due time, during
work hours, with the head teacher, upon reporting a convincing case of
force majeure.  The assignments are calibrated somewhat smaller for
those students.  Such an exception is only valid for the assignment(s)
it was negotiated for.</p>

<h2 id="ethics">Ethics</h2>

<p>The <a
href="https://www.it.uu.se/student/programmes_and_courses#cheating">legislation
on plagiarism and cheating</a> (<a
href="../../../ethics.html">summary</a>) of Uppsala University will be
rigorously applied, without exceptions.  This disallows using a public
repository (such as GitHub, where you should use a <a
href="https://education.github.com/pack">free private student
repository</a>) for code management within your team: this is
particularly important for part 2 of course 1DL442, where the same
quizzes and assignments and are used worldwide in a massive open
online course.  We reserve the right to use plagiarism detection tools
and point out that they are extremely powerful.</p>

<p><em><strong>When submitting you implicitly certify that your report
and all its uploaded attachments were produced solely by your team,
except where explicitly stated otherwise and clearly referenced, that
each teammate can individually explain any part starting from the
moment of submitting your report, and that your report and attachments
are not freely accessible on a public repository.</strong></em></p>

<p>We reserve the right to give different assignment scores to the
teammates of a team, depending on the performance at the grading
session.</p>

<p>Please report any problems within a team to the head teacher, who
will handle the case in confidence, in the best interest of both
teammates, keeping the ethics dimension in mind.</p>

<h2>Expected Effort</h2>

<p>One higher-education credit (ECTS credit) translates under Swedish
university law into an expected 26.67 hours of work for the average
student:</p>

<ul>
  
<li><p>The modelling assignments (of Course 1DL451 and Part 1 of
Course 1DL442, in period 1) are worth 3 credits: discounting about
half of the 21 hours spent on the lectures
<!-- and project presentation sessions -->
(the other half being similarly discounted on the 2 project credits),
<em><strong>the modelling assignments are calibrated to take about 21
hours of work on average by the average student, for each
teammate</strong></em>, including the help, grading, and solution
sessions.</p></li>

<li><p>The programming assignments (of Part 2 of Course 1DL442, in
period 2) are worth 5 credits: discounting the 22.5 hours spent on the
lectures and warm-up, <em><strong>the programming assignments are
calibrated to take about 37 hours of work on average by the average
student, for each teammate, including the help, grading, and solution
sessions</strong></em>.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>All this does not clash with other courses you are taking, as
university studies are legally defined to take 400 hours of work per
study period (normally 10 weeks), and the standard 15 credits targeted
in a study period are calibrated to reach that total.</p>

<h2>Assignment Grades</h2>

<ul>

<li><p>The <strong>modelling assignment grade</strong> for Course
1DL451 or for Part 1 of Course 1DL442 is determined by a <a
href="../grades.html#p1a">published scale</a>, depending on the
modelling assignment scores.</p></li>

<li><p>The <strong>programming assignment grade</strong> for Part 2 of
Course 1DL442 is determined by a <a
href="../grades.html#p2a">published scale</a>, depending on the
programming assignment scores.</p></li>

</ul>

<h2>Need Help?</h2>

<p>See <a href="../contact.html">Contact, Help, and FAQ</a>.</p>

<h2>Overall Grades</h2>

<ul>

<li><p>The <strong>overall grade</strong> for Course 1DL451 is
determined by a <a href="../grades.html#p1o">published scale</a>,
depending on the modelling assignment scores and the project
score.</p></li>

<li><p>The <strong>overall grade</strong> for Course 1DL442 is
determined by a <a href="../grades.html#p2o">published scale</a>,
depending on the modelling assignment scores, the project score, and
the programming assignment scores.</p></li>

</ul>

<!--
<h2>Failure</h2>

<p>There is normally no complementation opportunity as the full
budgeted time of the teachers is allocated within the two periods
where the courses take place: with two or three help sessions and one
grading session per assignment, there is a lot of support available
for submitting and improving a report that clears the low 20%
threshold (not 50% like in other courses!) per assignment, and for
clearing the 50% threshold over all assignments.</p>

<p>The lecture contents, assignment questions, submission rules, or
head teacher of a course can change from one academic year to another,
and the incremental completion of assignment duties over the years is
<em><strong>not</strong></em> a student right: it is best to complete
(the assignments of) a course the year it is taken. The head teacher
stopped granting that right (see the previous item) as the
administration thereof turned out to be more time-consuming than the
alternative.</p>
-->

<h2>Contract</h2>

<p>These rules are effective as of Mon 2 Sep 2024.  The head teacher
reserves the right to modify them at any moment, should special
circumstances call for this.</p>
