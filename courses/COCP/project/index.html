<h1>Modelling for Combinatorial Optimisation (course 1DL451) <br> & <br>
Combinatorial Optimisation and Constraint Programming (course 1DL442)</h1>

<p>(<a href="../course.html">back to the course homepage</a>)</p>

<h1>Project</h1>

<h2>Organisation</h2>

<p>The project is to be done in teams (<a
href="../assignments/index.html#Teams">team-building instructions</a>)
and is worth 2 higher-education credits (ECTS credits).  The main
objective of the project is to exercise further the theoretical
knowledge gained in the lectures, but on a problem that you propose
and that gets our approval.</p>

<p>Let an <em>approach</em> be either a MiniZinc model for the entire
problem, or a script (find a Python-based way of doing that at <a
href="../resources.html">Resources</a>) with pre-processing, solving
(possibly on a pipeline of multiple models), and post-processing.  We
are not just interested in a sufficiently complete and efficient
approach, but also in explanations and experimental evaluations, hence
<!-- a <strong>presentation</strong> and -->
a <strong>report</strong> is
<!-- are -->
also required for the project and the quality of the report determines
the project score.</p>

<p>Six <strong>help sessions</strong> are scheduled for the project.</p>

<p>PhD students do either the <a href="../assignments">assignments</a>
(possibly in a duo team), or just the project (solo; possibly in
connection with their PhD research; but they are highly encouraged to
do the <a href="../assignments">assignments</a> nevertheless), or both:
contact the head teacher.</p>

<h2>Project Proposal</h2>

<p>A <strong>project proposal</strong> of three problems, listed by
decreasing preference, each answering two questions (what?  which
third-party instance data?) must be submitted at Studium (as a single
file in .pdf format; all other formats will be rejected; state the
team number and the names of the team members): the head teacher and
assistants may interactively (via Studium) negotiate revisions with
you during the subsequent seven days until ideally our
<strong>approval</strong> (if approved, then <em>pass</em>, else
<em>fail</em>).  The problems can be your own or drawn from the
following websites (in the latter case, it suffices to name the
problem):
<ul>
  <!-- dropped from ht22 on, as most are too hard:

<p>Let us know if you think some problem ought to be taken off this
list, for instance because an approach with MiniZinc or OPL can be
found on the internet.  If your approach turns out to be competitive,
then you can even contribute it to the annual <a
href="https://www.minizinc.org/challenge.html">MiniZinc Challenge</a>
or to <a href="https://www.csplib.org">CSPlib</a>!</p>

<h2>Project Rules and Grading Criteria</h2>

<p>An approved project proposal entitles to continuation (deadlines
and schedule in the tables below):</p>

<ul>
  
  <li><p><strong>Initial report</strong>:
  <!-- , before your presentation: -->
  See the <a href="../slides/T01-Introduction.pdf#page=88">slides
  numbered 79 and 80 of Topic 1<a>.
  If your initial report is submitted on time at Studium and (1)
  follows the <a href="../demoReport/demo-project.pdf">imposed structure</a>
  of the demo report, which is longer than the one for assignments
  (LaTeX <a href="../demoReport/demoReport.zip">source</a>, if you
  use LaTeX: comment away line 15 and uncomment line 16),
  (2) cites the source of the problem and every included
  third-party picture, (3) has a description of the problem in your
  own words, (4) discusses a single approach (see above for the
  definition of approach), and (5) every model follows the structure
  of the <a href="../demoReport/skeleton.mzn">skeleton model</a>,
  then you <em>pass</em>,
  <!-- and are entitled to a presentation, -->
  else you <em>fail</em> and are not entitled to a
  <!-- presentation and -->
  final report.  One or two students are assigned at Studium for
  <!-- two phases of what is called <em>opposition</em>: -->
  written peer review(s) of your initial report: see below.</p>

  <p>The demo report has an additional task for project reports, and
  here are the instructions. <em>Correctness:</em> How do you argue
  for the correctness of the approach?  For example, did you use a
  checker based on another model, say a model by another team or a
  translation of a MIP model given somewhere?  Did you use the same
  new instances as another team?  If it is a satisfaction problem: did
  you compare the numbers of solutions with numbers reported somewhere
  or by another team? If it is an optimisation problem: did you
  compare objective values proven optimal before timing out
  (respectively objective values known when timing out) with optimal
  objective values (respectively best-known objective values) reported
  somewhere or by another team?</p>
  </li>

<!-- dropped from ht23 on:

  <li><p><strong>Presentation</strong>: If your presentation (1) is
  intelligible, and <em>either</em> (2a) the approach (single!)  and
  experiments are already complete <em>or</em> (2b) a convincing
  completion plan is outlined, and (3) the teammates speak for about
  the same time and (4) on about equally complex material, then you
  <em>pass</em> and are entitled to a final report, else you
  <em>fail</em> and are not entitled to a final report.</p>

  <p>
    If you are scheduled to present via Zoom, then you are
    encouraged to pre-record and upload your presentation (there is
    a link to a dropzone at an announcement in Studium: use
    <em>t</em><code>-presentation</code> as filename, where
    <em>t</em> is your team number), so that the Zoom host (a
    teacher) plays it (this works much better under Zoom than when a
    participant plays it), but you can also present live.
    If you are scheduled to present in an auditorium, then

  Figure out <em>in advance</em> how to connect your hardware to the
  projector and how to make your voice carry over the entire
  auditorium.

    Either way, your faces must be visible during your presentation.

  Your presentation must be 12 to 15 minutes long (and will be
  interrupted after 15 minutes).

    The presentation sessions will not be recorded.
  </p>
  </li>
      
  <li><p><strong>Slides</strong>: If your actual presentation slides
  are submitted on time at Studium and follow the <a
  href="../demoSlides/demoSlides.pdf">imposed structure</a> of the demo
  slides (LaTeX <a href="../demoSlides">source</a>, if you use LaTeX),
  then you <em>pass</em>, else you <em>fail</em>.</p>
  </li>

  <li><p><strong>Oral opposition</strong>: If each member of your
  opposition team

    (1)

  orally asks you constructive questions immediately after your
  presentation

    and (2) their faces are visible while doing so,

  then they <em>pass</em>, else they <em>fail</em>.

    Recall that the presentation sessions will not be recorded if
    you present via Zoom.

  </p>

  <p>Opposition teams and the rest of the audience are encouraged to
  have the modelling <a href="../demoReport/checklist.pdf">checklists</a>
  of the final slides of Topics 2 and 3 handy during the
  presentations.</p>
  </li>

-->

  <li>
  <p>
  <strong>Written peer review</strong>: If
  you (1) attach (<a href="how-to-attach-a-PDF.png">like this</a>) a peer review
  to the initial report of your assigned team on time at Studium
  (so that the other team can see your review),
  and (2) submit your peer review on time also at Studium to the assignment
  "Project Peer Review" (so that the teachers can grade it),
  and (3) your peer review is individually written (a duo team writes two reviews)
  and (4) constructive
  and (5) follows the imposed <a href="peer-review-form.pdf">form</a>
  (<a href="peer-review-instructions.pdf">instructions</a>,
  plus: Author = team number of the initial report you review,
  and: Advisor = your name),
  then you <em>pass</em>, else you <em>fail</em>.
  </p>
  </li>

  <li><p><strong>Final report</strong>: The
  written peer review(s) and feedback by the teachers
  will help you prepare your final report (including model and data
  files, if not other code; there is no imposed filename): it will get
  a score \(p \in 0..10\), under (1--5) the same conditions as the
  initial report, but (6) it is rewritten where relevant and not just
  expanded incrementally.</p>
  </li>

<!-- dropped from ht23 on:

  <li><p><strong>Attendance</strong> at <em>all</em> project
  presentation sessions is <em>mandatory</em>: each missed project
  presentation session (in case of no force majeure) can be
  compensated for by writing a two-page summary of a research paper
  chosen by the head teacher.</p>
  </li>

-->
  
</ul>

<!-- dropped from ht23 on:
<p> A detailed timetable giving the day and duration of your
presentation will be made available here in due time.</p>

<h2>Presentation & Opposition Timetable for Autumn 2022, including Location</h2>

<p>See the <a href="project-timetable.html">presentation & opposition
timetable</a>.
-->

<h2>Submission and Deadlines</h2>

<p>The project proposal, initial and final reports,
<!-- slides, -->
and peer review must be submitted electronically via Studium, whose
clock may be different from yours.  Submission deadlines are
<em><strong>hard</strong></em>.  Exceptions must be negotiated in due
time during work hours with the head teacher, upon reporting a
convincing case of force majeure.  Grading will only start after a
deadline, so you can submit multiple times until then.</p>

<h2>Ethics</h2>

<p>The <a href="../assignments/index.html#ethics">considerations on ethics
of the assignment reports</a> also apply to the project report.
<!-- and slides. -->
</p>

<p>We reserve the right to give different project scores to the
teammates of a team, depending for example on the performance at the
<!-- presentations and opposition. -->
peer review.</p>

<h2>Expected Effort</h2>

<p>Each higher-education credit (ECTS credit) translates under Swedish
university law into an expected 26.67 hours of work for the average
student.  The project is worth 2 credits: discounting about half of
the 21 hours spent in period 1 on the lectures
<!-- and project presentation sessions -->
(the other half being similarly discounted on the 3 assignment
credits), <em><strong>the project and peer review should reflect 49.5
hours of work by the average student, for each teammate</strong></em>.
This does not clash with other courses you are taking, as university
studies are legally defined to take 400 hours of work per study period
(normally 10 weeks), and the standard 15 credits targeted in a study
period are calibrated to reach that total.</p>

<h2>Project Grade</h2>

<p>The <strong>project grade</strong> is determined by a <a
href="../grades.html#p1p">published scale</a>, depending on your project
score \(p \in 0..10\).</p>

<h2>Need Help?</h2>

<p>See <a href="../contact.html">Contact, Help, and FAQ</a>.</p>

<h2>Overall Grades</h2>

<ul>

<li><p>The <strong>overall grade</strong> for Course 1DL451 is
determined by a <a href="../grades.html#p1o">published scale</a>,
depending on the modelling assignment scores and the project score
\(p\).</p></li>

<li><p>The <strong>overall grade</strong> for Course 1DL442 is
determined by a <a href="../grades.html#p2o">published scale</a>,
depending on the modelling assignment scores, the project score \(p\),
and the programming assignment scores.</p></li>

</ul>

<h2>Contract</h2>

<p>These rules are effective as of Mon 2 Sep 2024.  The head teacher
reserves the right to modify them at any moment, should special
circumstances call for this.</p>
