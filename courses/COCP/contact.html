<h1>Contact, Help, Ethics, and FAQ</h1>

<h2>Contact &amp; Help &amp; Ethics</h2>

<p>Before contacting anyone for help, please check whether your
question has an answer in the FAQ list below.  If not:</p>

<ul>

  <li><p>If you have a question about the <strong>lecture
  material</strong> or <strong>course organisation</strong>, then
  contact the <a href="../../contact.html">head teacher</a>.  An
  immediate answer will be given right before and after lectures, as
  well as during their breaks.</p></li>

  <li><p>If you have a question about the
  <strong>assignments</strong>, <strong>project</strong>, or
  <strong>infrastructure</strong>, then contact the assistants at a
  help or solution session for an immediate answer.  Short
  <em>clarification</em> questions (that is: <em>not</em> about
  modelling or programming issues) that are emailed to the <a
  href="mailto:it-COCP@lists.uu.se">M4CO/COCP helpdesk</a> or posted
  to its Discussion at Studium are answered as soon as possible during
  working days and hours.  No answer means that you should go to a
  help session: almost all the assistants' budgeted time is allocated
  to grading and to the help, grading, and solution sessions.</p></li>
  
  <li><p>You may ask MiniZinc-specific questions in public to the
  MiniZinc Team via their <a
  href="https://groups.google.com/g/minizinc">MiniZinc Discussion
  Group</a>.  <em><strong>First</strong></em> check the archive of
  this forum, as your question may already be answered there.  Do
  <em><strong>not</strong></em> ask for advice on modelling in
  general, or on how to solve an assignment.  To report an issue to
  the MiniZinc developers, follow the relevant link at <a

<h2>Ethics</h2>

<p>The <a
href="https://www.it.uu.se/student/programmes_and_courses#cheating">legislation
on plagiarism and cheating</a> (<a
href="../../ethics.html">summary</a>) of Uppsala University will be
rigorously applied, without exceptions.  This disallows using a public
repository (such as GitHub, where you should use a <a
href="https://education.github.com/pack">free private student
repository</a>) for code management within your team: this is
particularly important for part 2 of course 1DL442, where the same
quizzes and assignments and are used worldwide in a massive open
online course.  We reserve the right to use plagiarism detection tools
and point out that they are extremely powerful.</p>

<p><em><strong>When submitting you implicitly certify that your report

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) and Answers</h2>

<h3>A. Generalities</h3>

<ol>

  <li><p><strong>Which of the two courses (M4CO and COCP) should I
  choose?</strong>
  The <a href="https://www.uu.se/en/study/course?query=1DL442">COCP course
  goals</a> form a superset of the <a href="https://www.uu.se/en/study/course?query=1DL451">M4CO course
  goals</a>: M4CO (period 1) is actually the first half of COCP
  (periods 1 and 2).</p>

  <p>M4CO does not explain (in detail) the algorithms within the solvers
  of the various solving technologies in the MiniZinc toolchain: we just
  use them, which is difficult enough given that declarative modelling
  (stating <em>what</em> problem is to be solved) is a totally alien
  concept to students who are only used to procedural programming
  (stating <em>how</em> to solve the problem).</p>

  <p>The second half of COCP fully explains all the algorithms within
  solvers of CP (constraint programming) technology, whereas the algorithms
  within solvers of other technologies (SAT, MIP, etc) are explained to
  some degree in other courses.  For example, <a href="https://www.uu.se/en/study/course?query=1TD184">course
  1TD184</a> (Optimisation) explains some algorithms within the solvers of
  MIP (mixed integer programming) technology, among other things,
  and is thus orthogonal and complementary to both M4CO and COCP:
  so it is up to you to decide how much and which optimisation you
  want to study.  Another difference is that course 1TD184 is about
  <em>continuous</em> optimisation (over real numbers), whereas M4CO and
  COCP are about combinatorial (or: <em>discrete</em>) optimisation
  (over discrete sets, such as integers, enumerations, etc).</p>

  <p>Note that CP solvers are crucial for
  <a href="https://dtai.cs.kuleuven.be/CP4IM/miningzinc">MiningZinc</a>,
  a data-mining extension to MiniZinc, so understanding CP is
  useful if you want to study declarative mining.</p>

  </li>
  
  <li><p><strong>Will I get rich after passing this course?</strong>
  There is no limit to the need for competent experts on combinatorial
  optimisation.  See some <a
  href="https://www.a4cp.org/success-stories">CP success stories</a>
  and the articles <a
  href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1109/MIS.2009.25">Constraint Programming
  in Sweden</a>,
  <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1109/MIS.2000.820324">Constraint
  Technology and the Commercial World</a> (these links work from the
  UU network), and
  <a href="http://www.constraint-programming.com/letters/Papers/v1/wallace.pdf">Constraint
  Programming -- The Paradigm to Watch</a>, for instance.</p></li>

</ol>

<h3>B. Lectures, Slides, and Literature</h3>

<ol>

  <li><p><strong>Which book, if any, should I buy?</strong> The
  reference book (not textbook) by Apt is primarily for those who
  would like to know more about the mathematical foundations of
  constraint programming.  However, many passing students reported
  having bought no book at all, relying solely on the <a
  href="lectures.html">lecture slides and extra material</a> as well
  as the <a href="resources.html">Resources</a> page.</p></li>
  
  <li><p><strong>What to do if I missed a lecture?  Why are the
  lecture slides so concise, rather than telling the whole
  story?</strong> Lecture slides are by construction just the backbone
  for interactive teaching: they contain the essential results,
  models, and algorithms, so that no time is spent writing them
  to/from the blackboard.  Also, a teacher complements this backbone
  with a lot of important insights, both in writing on the blackboard
  and in talking, so the attending students ought to <em><strong>take
  notes</strong></em> in order to document the complete story.  If you
  take no notes or missed a lecture, then the slides alone often do
  not suffice to reconstruct the complete story, so you should then
  consult other sources, such as the <a href="lectures.html">extra
  material or the reference book</a>, and should ask an attending
  student (not a teacher) which material was covered in your
  absence.</p></li>
  
  <li><p><strong>Why are there not more examples and solved exercises
  in lectures?</strong> Like every course, this course has a required
  theoretical content (<a
  href="https://www.uu.se/en/study/course?query=1DL442">course
  goals for COCP</a> and <a
  href="https://www.uu.se/en/study/course?query=1DL451">course
  goals for M4CO</a>) and the standard time budget (students are 33%
  fulltime on this course, and no teacher is anywhere near fulltime on
  any course): the balance of theory and practice in the lectures
  simply follows from these data and is not a sign of our bad will.
  On the contrary, if allocated more time (but this is impossible),
  then we would love to offer additional practical problem solving
  sessions.  Note that there are help and solution sessions for the
  assignments.</p></li>
    
</ol>

<h3>C. Assignments, Project, Help Sessions, Grading Sessions, and
Solution Sessions</h3>

<ol>

  <li><p><strong>Why are there not more assistants?  Why are there not
  more examples and solved / supervised exercises by assistants in
  lessons?</strong> Like every course, this course has the standard
  time budget (students are 33% fulltime on this course, and no
  teacher is anywhere near fulltime on any course): the number of
  sessions simply follows from these data and is not a sign of our bad
  will.  On the contrary, if allocated more time (but this is
  impossible), then we would love to offer additional practical
  problem solving sessions.</p></li>
  
  <li><p><strong>How do I best use my time, and yours, in order to
  solve an assignment?</strong> Prepare your solution as far as
  possible until the corresponding help sessions, in order to make
  best use of those reserved timespans of personal attention by the
  assistants.  This is much more effective than going to a help
  session, printing out the assignment statement (which was published
  at least a week before the first help session and often does not
  require any material taught in the meantime), and not meeting all
  the difficulties until the end of the two session hours.</p></li>

  <li><p><strong>Why is there not more email support for the
  assignments and project?</strong> We have scheduled almost all the
  standard time budget for the lectures, help sessions, grading
  sessions, solution sessions, grading, and preparation.  This is why
  we can only answer to emailed short questions that trigger brief reply
  times, and this is a more personal and rational way of spending the
  standard time budget: more email support would inevitably result in
  fewer help sessions.</p></li>
  
  <li><p><strong>I am lost! Why do the assignment statements not tell
  us <em>how</em> to solve the questions?</strong> Stating only
  <em>what</em> output has to be computed from the inputs is a
  pedagogical choice.  In real-life engineering problems, you are not
  asked to solve a problem by using method <em>m</em> on page
  <em>p</em> of textbook <em>t</em>.  Come to some of the help
  sessions of an assignment in order to get advice on what is wrong
  with your current solution or hints on <em>how</em> to proceed.  If
  you think a task is insufficiently described in terms of its
  parameters and constraints, then contact the teachers: we vet
  problem descriptions with utmost care and no flaws are due to
  purpose or sloppiness.</p></li>
  
  <li><p><strong>Why are the assignment questions not in sync with the
  lecture contents, nor closer to them?</strong> See the answer to the
  previous question.</p></li>

  <li><p><strong>Why are there not a lot of small assignments rather
  than the few bigger ones?</strong> Combinatorial optimisation is
  best practised not by drill of small questions with no relation to
  each other or real life, but by tackling bigger assignments, which
  have been selected as examples of the infinite variety of
  interesting questions that occur in real life.</p></li>

  <li><p><strong>Why do we need to hand in reports in addition to
  code?</strong> This is a course on combinatorial optimisation and
  your code has to be experimentally evaluated, hence a report is
  needed, as we are not just interested in your models, but also in
  how you discovered and evaluated them.  Also note that this course
  was chosen in order to fulfil the curriculum goal of the ability to
  communicate orally and in writing: see the <a
  href="https://www.uu.se/en/study/course?query=1DL442">course
  goals for 1DL442</a> and the <a
  href="https://www.uu.se/en/study/course?query=1DL451">course
  goals for 1DL451</a>.</p></li>

  <li><p><strong>Why do we not get more finegrained feedback on our
  assignment reports and code?</strong> Our solution sessions are a
  more rational way to use the standard time budget: we give
  collective feedback instead of finegrained teamwise feedback.  More
  detailed comments can be obtained orally from the assistants upon
  appointment.</p></li>
  
  <li><p><strong>Why can I not do the assignments alone?</strong>
  Teamwork is usually a very rewarding experience, whether you learn
  from or teach to the other student, especially for a course like
  this where the assignments and project are unlike almost everything
  you have seen before: choose a teammate whose skills are not
  interchangeable with yours.  Note that the assignments are downsized
  for students who work alone and have an approved reason for
  this.</p></li>
    
</ol>

<h3>D. Credit Points and Overall Grades</h3>

<ol>

  <li><p><strong>I will miss (or have missed) a mandatory event: is
  pre-booked travel considered force majeure?</strong> Of course
  <em><strong>not</strong></em>: full-time students are expected to
  work full-time during all working days and working hours, so all
  absences are at the risk of the student and no exceptions are made
  for travelling students, especially that the schedules, including
  the mandatory events, are published many weeks in advance.</p></li>

  <li><p><strong>I passed the assignments or project, but why are my
  credit points not reported yet to Ladok?</strong> Studium is
  <em><strong>not</strong></em> automatically reporting awarded credit
  points to Ladok, but there is a manual process involved in that.  So
  be patient and do <em><strong>not</strong></em> worry until at least
  a month after the official end of the course.</p></li>
  
</ol>

<h3>E. Resources, Contact, Help, FAQ, Evaluation, and Feedback</h3>

<ol>

  <li><p><strong>How do I install the MiniZinc and MiniCP
  toolchains on my own computer?</strong> See the <a
  href="resources.html">Resources</a> page.</p></li>
  
  <li><p><strong>Why do I not get a reply to my emailed
  query?</strong> On working days and hours, you can normally expect a
  reply within a few hours, provided the question is brief, unanswered
  in this FAQ, and answerable in a short time.</p></li>
  
  <li><p><strong>Are you interested in additional links to great
  internet resources?</strong> Yes, absolutely!  Send us an email with
  links, and we will add the best ones to the <a
  href="resources.html">Resources</a> page.</p></li>
