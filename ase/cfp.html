<h2>Aim</h2>

The first step in idealised software engineering is to abstract a precise
specification, which is then taken as the foundation for all subsequent
development, such as coding and testing.  However, complex specifications
typically contain errors and approximations that lead to errors in the
eventual software, errors that are not easily detected or eliminated before
the software is subjected to operational testing.

<p> Many programming problems are manifest as sets of data values, namely
inputs and corresponding outputs.  Inductive programming techniques work
from such data instances to the implementation without going through a
specification.  They thus offer the software engineer a means to avoid or
rectify specification-induced system errors and perhaps even to circumvent
the need for a complete a priori specification, i.e., <I>some</I> system
modules may be inductively generated from data where accurate specification
proves difficult.  Induction-based processing of problem data may be used
to check and correct features of a specification.  Inductive software
development will be particularly germane, if not essential, for complex
data-defined problems, or problem modules.  These will arise in a data-rich
domain and address very complex aspects of the world, such as the human
body, complicated manufacturing processes, and complex dynamical
situations.

<p> Inductive programming is not, however, trouble-free.  There are
difficult issues of `understanding' the automatic induction procedures so
that implementation performance can be characterised.  There are issues of
data pre-processing to facilitate optimal application of a given inductive
technique and to obtain an implementation with certain desired
characteristics.


<h2>Scope</h2>

The intent of this special issue is to bring together developments in
inductive programming that have a direct bearing on software development.
Papers are sought on novel uses of such inductive techniques, whether
automatic or interactive, for practical software development.  It is
anticipated that relevant work is to be found in a variety of different
areas, including rule induction, neural computing, data mining, machine
learning, and inductive logic programming.

<p>We solicit papers about, but not limited to, the following topics:

<ul>
<li>Inductive software engineering methodologies
    (both practical examples and analytical treatments).</li>
<li>Inductive augmentations of conventional methodologies.</li>
<li>New developments in the inductive techniques themselves,
    with a potential software engineering application.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Submission Guidelines</h2>

Accepted papers must be prepared using the ASE author
instructions (available from the
<A HREF="http://www.wkap.nl/journalhome.htm/0928-8910">ASE homepage</A>).

<p> Although there is no restriction on length, we would prefer shorter
papers to longer ones, for the sake of greater diversity and more thorough
reviewing.  Authors are therefore encouraged to be as concise as possible,
and to limit their papers to 30 pages.

<p> Electronic submissions are encouraged, and may be sent as one email (to
both guest editors), MIME attachments being allowed.  The message should
contain (i) the abstract and author names and addresses in ASCII, and (ii)
the whole paper in Postscript or PDF.  A Postscript version must be
interpretable by Ghostscript, and must use standard fonts, or include the
necessary fonts.  Authors who cannot meet these requirements should submit
5 hard copies by post instead (to either of the guest editors).

<p> All submitted papers will be refereed according to the usual ASE
refereeing process.

<p> To aid planning and organisation, we would appreciate an email or a
letter of intent to submit a paper (including author information, a
tentative title and abstract, and an estimated number of pages) as early as
possible.
