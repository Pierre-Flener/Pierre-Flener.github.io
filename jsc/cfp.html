<h2>
Aim</h2>
<p>
Schemas play an important and versatile role in symbolic computation. For 
general problem solving, schemas can be used to capture and codify 
knowledge that represents recognised successful processes and solutions,
which can be repeatedly used for constructing sub-processes with
smaller search spaces for sub-solutions, and so on. In 
particular, they have made significant contributions to
areas like theorem proving and program synthesis by
formulating more efficient proof or synthesis strategies that are
amenable to automation, and by producing 
better-engineered solutions overall.;
Nowadays, the most successful approaches to automation in these areas
are schema-guided, and we believe that such approaches have the 
potential to be equally successful for automated reasoning and 
software engineering in general.
</p>
<p>
The aim of  this special issue of the <I><A HREF="http://www.cis.udel.edu/~caviness/jsc.html">Journal
of Symbolic Computation</A></I> is to furnish a collection of seminal work on
schemas in diverse areas of symbolic computation, with a view to
encouraging future work and at the same time providing a sound starting point
for it.
</p>
<h2>
Scope</h2>
<p>
We solicit papers on all aspects and
all kinds of schemas that are relevant to symbolic computation. Schemas could 
represent any artifacts or processes. For example, in automated reasoning and 
software engineering, they could correspond to strategies
or templates for proofs, programs, algorithms, specifications, synthesis,
transformation, etc. We also welcome alternative approaches or
terminologies, such as patterns, frameworks, skeletons,
clich&eacute;s, plans, etc., provided
there is some (potential for) automation.
</p>
Whatever the chosen form or terminology, however, authors must address
at least the following points:
<ul>
<li>definition</li>
<li>representation</li>
<li>semantics</li>
<li>application</li>
</ul>
<P> 

<h2>
Submission Guidelines</h2>
<P>Papers may be submitted to any guest editor (see
addresses below).&nbsp; They must be prepared by using the JSC
 LaTeX style file, which can be
obtained from <A HREF="ftp://ftp.udel.edu/pub/jsc">ftp://ftp.udel.edu/pub/jsc</A>
(North-America) or 
from <A
 HREF="ftp://ftp.risc.uni-linz.ac.at/pub/jsc">ftp://ftp.risc.uni-linz.ac.at/pub/jsc</A> (Europe).
</p>
<p>
Although there is no restriction on length, we would prefer shorter
papers to longer ones, for the sake of greater diversity and more
thorough reviewing. Authors are therefore encouraged to be as concise as
possible, and to limit their papers to 30 pages. 
</p>
<p>
Electronic submissions are encouraged, and may be sent as one email
(MIME attachments are allowed). The message should contain (i) the  
abstract in ASCII and (ii) the whole paper in Postscript. The  
Postscript form must be interpretable by Ghostscript, and must
use standard fonts, or include the necessary fonts.
Authors who cannot meet these requirements should submit 5 hard copies
by post instead.
</p>
<p>
All submitted papers will be refereed according to the
usual JSC refereeing process.
</p>
<p>
To aid planning and organisation, we would appreciate an email or a
letter of intent to submit a paper (including author information,
a tentative title and abstract, and an estimated number of pages)
as early as possible.
