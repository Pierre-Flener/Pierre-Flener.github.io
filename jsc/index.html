<h2>
Aim</h2>
<p>
Schemas play an important and versatile role in symbolic computation. For 
general problem solving, schemas can be used to capture and codify 
knowledge that represents recognised successful processes and solutions,
which can be repeatedly used for constructing sub-processes with
smaller search spaces for sub-solutions, and so on. In 
particular, they have made significant contributions to
areas like theorem proving and program synthesis by
formulating more efficient proof or synthesis strategies that are
amenable to automation, and by producing 
better-engineered solutions overall.
Nowadays, the most successful approaches to automation in these areas
are schema-guided, and we believe that such approaches have the 
potential to be equally successful for automated reasoning and 
software engineering in general.
</p>
<p>
The aim of  this special issue of the <A HREF="http://www4.ncsu.edu/~hong/jsc.htm">Journal
of Symbolic Computation</A> is to furnish a collection of seminal work on
schemas in diverse areas of symbolic computation, with a view to
encouraging future work and at the same time providing a sound starting point
for it.
