<P>This present issue reflects my perception of how the Turkish mind works
and of what makes it tick, as seen through a "Westerner's" eyes.  I know in
advance that I will be heavily criticized for some of my observations, but
note that there is often <I>no</I> judgment involved:  I mostly
<I>mention</I> differences between the "Western" mind-set and the Turkish
one, with a definite generalization to "Mediterranean" (which includes
Greeks, Armenians, and Kurds, so please don't take any anti-Turkish
ammunition here, because that will inevitably back-fire) and a possible
generalization to "Asian" for the latter.  These differences are what will
strike "Western" visitors most, if not annoy or exasperate them, but such a
head-on clash between two mind-sets is inevitable, and, once accepted,
contributes to the many joys of discovering Turkey.

<P>Some will ask me why I feel like having to "apologize" (in advance) for
what's coming below, as I should have the freedom to write what I want to
write.  But, as hinted above, experience tells me that especially some of
my Turkish readers will not take kindly to some of my observations, and
that they will send me hate mail.  I also know that many Turks agree with
me on many of these matters.  Unfortunately, some are not open to analysis
or constructive criticism at all.

<P>Most Turks have indeed been exposed to only two forms of prose about
their country:  Armenian/Greek/...-written hate-"literature" (and the
Internet has a fair share of that), and unconditional "declarations of
love" by "Western" tourists (and the Internet again has many of these).
The problem with the former is that it is so blatantly negative and biased,
and often written by people who have never even put a foot onto Turkish
soil to verify their claims or experience what they pretend having
experienced.  The problem with the latter is that they are so outrageously
positive and naive:  they entirely revolve around what my friend YalCIn
calls the "Turkish delight & SiS kebap" axis, and thus provide a form of
what he calls "[mental] masturbation" to the Turkish community, the
enjoying of which is "induced by an inferiority [complex]" that is entirely
unjustified.  Indeed, Turks are invari- ably anxious to know what
foreigners think about their country, to the point that, hoping that their
visitors have overcome their prejudices, they will put the words into your
mouth:  "We <I>are</I> a nice people, aren't we?"  What follows go into
neither of these two categories, and tries to fill the missing space
in-between them.

<RIGHT>Arabia for its blessings, but in kindliness Turks excel.<BR>
--Arabic adage of the 14th century

<P>[We] set out for the country of the Turks known as Bilad ar-Rum
[Anatolia], because it was in ancient times their [the Greeks'] land.
Later on it was conquered by the Muslims, but there are still large numbers
of Christians there under the government of the Turkmen Muslims.  [...]
[We] reached Alaya [Alanya?], where the province begins.  This country is
one of the best in the world; in it God has united the good features
dispersed throughout other lands.  Its people are the most comely of men,
the cleanest in their dress, the most exquisite in their food, and the
kindliest folk in creation.  Wherever we stopped in this land, whether at a
hospice or a private house, our neighbors both men and women (these do not
veil themselves) came to ask after us.  When we left them they bade us
farewell as though they were our relatives and our own folk, and you would
see the women weeping.  They bake bread only once a week, and the men used
to bring us gifts of warm bread on the day it was baked, along with
delicious viands, saying "The women have sent this to you and beg your
prayers."<BR>

<H2>The Turkish Approach to Problem Solving</H2>

After millenia of deforestation in central Anatolia (the bronze and iron
ages meant high needs for wood-fueled ovens in this cradle of civilization,
not to mention agricultural needs for land, the construction of navies
along the coast, and grazing by goats, the "curse of Asia"), there are not
many natural forests left here, so that the color "green" can barely be
seen from many panorama points.  Aware of this, the Turks are running many
re-forestation programmes, and, despite the slow growth in these arid
areas, the results are already impressive.  Unfortunately, due to a weird
"perversion", these new forests are planted in chequerboard fashion, so
that you can see through the entire forest wherever you stand!  Funny, no?,
that the Turks organize things that should go unorganized (and forests
should be synonyms of organic growth), while, at the same time, so many
things that "should" be organized go without organization (such as suburban
development)!

<P>In general now, the notions of symmetry and perfection[ism] seem pretty
much absent from many Turkish minds (except for the cited "perversion"
regarding forests), so that many results of design, engineering,
construction, handicraft, etc., are shabby:  parallel walls, bricks, and
tiles are rare (the Italian bricklayer's nightmare vision), doors and
windows often don't fit exactly, plumbing and wiring are somehow attached
outside the walls, paint is splattered all around the painted objects,
tekst is'nt spelczecked (sic) nor grammar-checked, and so on.  (It is of
course debatable whether the "Western" attribution of beauty to symmetric
and perfect things is the only valid approach.)  Turkey is an unread
open-air textbook on fabulous ancient architecture, which will still stand
when the shoddy contemporary concrete prefab houses have long crumbled away
early next century.  Eighty percent correctness and operationality seem
perfectly adequate for most Turks, which drives quality-conscious
"Westerners" out of their minds with despair.  If something doesn't work, a
quick fix will be done, which will do until the next (inevitable)
dysfunction.  Turks definitely do not form a problem-solving nation:
symptoms are discarded, but causes are rarely looked for.  The "rock
parable" sometimes cited for other nations also applies here:  suppose a
heavy boulder rolls onto a road.  Well, Turks will drive around it, which
eventually creates a bypass dirtroad, but the facts that the unannounced
obstacle is a danger, and that it can even be removed (gasp!), don't come
to their minds!

<P>Of course, there are situations where such Turkish-style flexibility and
improvisation talent come in handy.  Turkish mechanics, for instance, are
unsurpassed when it comes to getting your car rolling again, even in the
absence of tools or spare parts (this often out of sheer necessity).  It
will only do for a small distance, but if that's what's needed to get you
out of the wilderness, you will be mighty grateful.  Turks have an uncanny
sense of fixing the impossible!  Another point is that there are things
that don't have to be played by the rules:  one of my objectives in moving
to Turkey was to get out of the overly tight Germanic straight-jacket that
imposes "must"s and "don't"s in too great abundance.  I'm maybe slowly
getting there, hopefully eventually striking the "right" balance, but the
exasperating thing is that here <I>almost everything</I> is improvised and
somehow rigged together, so that I live at the opposite end of the spectrum
now!  There is no organization, no scheduling, no foresight, no discipline,
no optimization, no quality control, just a lot of hard work.  Sometimes I
try to imagine where Turkey would be with, say, German organization talent
and Swiss precision:  probably a major economic power!  What are the
reasons for such an evident lack of job ethics and job pride?  Is it
"genetic", in the sense that nomadic features are still perspiring through?
Or is it that most workers are so poorly paid and overloaded with work that
they cannot care about perfection?  Or is that the State (as the modern
successor to the omnipotent Sultan) somehow favors such a system, in the
sense that people don't want to invest into an uncertain future?  Probably
all of these reasons apply, and maybe others?


<H2>The Turkish Lifestyle</H2>

Considering the Central Asian origins of Turks, it is amazing how much they
have changed their lifestyles after migrating to Anatolia and mixing with
the indigenous and other migrated people.  To a certain extent, calling the
country "Turkey" and the people "Turks" is actually a misnomer, as the only
thing Turkish is the official language (and yogurt!).  Everything else is a
blend of Turkish, Arab, Persian, Kurdish, Armenian, Greek, Roman,
Caucasian, etc., to the point where almost anybody can visually pass for a
"Turk".  This cultural and ethnic mix, plus the influence of Islam on a
formerly schamanistic society, is my only explanation for many apparent
paradoxes, such as the following (so "Turk" here stands for "citizen of the
Turkish Republic):

<UL>

<LI> Turks have little inclination to travel, even though their ancestors
have roamed virtually the entire Asian continent, and more, in search for
new territories.  Today, it is not unheard of that village people know how
to get to istanbul or Ankara, but have no clue where a certain dirt-road
out of their village is actually leading to.  This unadventurous spirit
seems linked to their general attitude to efforts, as already conveyed in
the 4th and 5th issues of this diary (biking and hiking).</LI>

<LI> Turks seem immune to air pollution, because twice-overloaded trucks
creep up hills, surrounded by choking black clouds (hey, but then Turks
also smoke like coal engines); to noise pollution, because truck/bus
engines are left running at roadside cafes, there is a constant cacophony
of honking, radios are being played loudly in-midst of pristine nature
(some foreign observers go as far as saying that Turks <I>like</I>
noise...); and to land pollution, as conveyed in the 5th issue of this
diary.  Again, considering their origins, one would rather consider that
they would prefer fresh air, silence, and a clean environment, no?  (Of
course, such environmental concerns are a luxury, in which even the "west"
didn't indulge for a long time.)</LI>

<LI> Turks have adopted other strange things:  gone are the times of
"free-range" Turks, now that ugly, and often utterly useless, fences are
the fashion.</LI>

<LI> However, Turks have also preserved some things from ancient times,
unaware that they are incompatible with "modern" times:  garbage is often
left where it occurs (bis repetita), even though it's rarely biodegradable;
rural pedestrians don't pay attention to the traffic; recently urbanized
peasants lack the skills of living in a city (they walk out of shops onto
the sidewalk without looking whether they will bump into pedestrians; when
walking, usually in the middle of the sidewalk, they sometimes stop and
believe they have "ceased to exist", because they are oblivious to the fact
that the whole pedestrian traffic is impeded by their standing there);
etc.</LI>

</UL>

Other things come as a complete surprise to me, considering the deservedly
legendary friendliness and hospitality of Turks.  The most annoying one is
the considerable lack of respect for others (what would you expect of a
nation where seemingly fifty percent of the population smokes itself into
early death?)  and of self-respect.  The best illustrations of the lack of
respect for each other are the way they drive (see the dedicated section
below) and their enormous lack of first-come first-served discipline when
"queuing" for a service.  The "everybody does it" mentality will of course
not solve this frustrating issue.  Another example is the street sweeper
who sweeps the dust onto the legs of passersby.  The self-respect issue has
already been illustrated above with the job ethics discussion.

<P>To illustrate this, a (Turkish) colleague told me the following joke:
in the kitchens of Hell, the Devil has some cooking pots in which he
prepares broth from people of the various nationalities.  The Devil's aides
are busy with big wooden spoons to push back the people who try to scramble
out of the pots.  Except for one pot in the back of the kitchen, which
boils completely unsupervised.  "That's the pot with the Turks," the Devil
explains, "whenever one of them gets almost out of the pot, the others will
pull him back."

<P>At first, I did not fully understand this joke, only seeing it from the
driving and queuing perspective.  But then I realized that some Turkish
friends stoop whenever I tell them what a friendly and helpful people the
Turks are.  Although I still have trouble believing this, it appears that
these virtues are indeed mostly (in urban areas) reserved for dealing with
foreigners:  Turks won't go out of their way for helping each other as much
as they will do for foreign visitors.  As I said, it hurts me to accept
this as a fact, and I dearly hope it's not true.


<H2>The Turkish Society</H2>

The Turkish society is extremely class conscious:  there must be hundreds
of class layers.  Just look at the many ranks among waiters in restaurants!
Or the tea-man who considers himself very much superior to the
cleaning-man, although "Western" society wouldn't make a difference between
them.

<P>At a broad level now, it must be noted that Turkey has almost no middle
class:  it's vanishing very fast, as the richer get richer, and the poor
poorer.  But I would also say that very few people are extremely poor, in
the sense that they couldn't afford at least one daily meal.  The income
distribution is pathetic:  the multiplier between the lowest salary and the
highest income is absolutely incredible here (ten to the three at least?).
Some people would even be rich by "Western" standards, because otherwise
they couldn't afford the latest Mercedes, which, all things considered, is
three times more expensive here than back home, although salaries are many
times lower here than back home:  there seems no way anybody could, with
honest work only, afford a Mercedes in just one life-time, and still feed a
family and have a roof!  Of course, a fast way to wealth here is to rip off
the wealthy (and they seem happy about being ripped off at just about every
opportunity), so that, after all, a Mercedes <I>is</I> affordable in one
life-time...  One of my favorite examples of ripping off the rich is what I
call the "tuna fish war":  at least two companies (unnamed here, because I
don't want to further their interests) have decided that (rich) Turks
should eat tuna fish, and they advertise their excessively expensive
produce so aggressively that one soon feels guilty of not eating tuna fish!
And they of course have a "low-calorie, diet" version:  it must be strange
for many Turks to find out that some people here want to eat just for
keeping their stomachs busy.  The rich circulate money (sucked from the
poor) among themselves in amounts that would buy the same products in a
"Western" country, oblivious to the fact that these things should be N
times cheaper here; but maybe they are happy to be able to spend that much
money, as it gives them "standing"?

<H2>The Turkish Labor Market</H2>

My real-life joke about PTT (in the 1st issue of this diary) hinted at a
colossal dinosaur of misunderstood and over-staffed bureaucracy here in
Turkey.  Nowadays I know that nothing, not even trivial things, can get
done in less than half a day, and that many additional, unexpected, and
illogical hurdles are thrown into your way on every bureaucratic venture.
"Expect the unexpected", Murphy's Law, and Hofstadter's Law ("it always
takes twice as long as you expected, even if you take Hofstadter's Law into
account") are very accurate here.  But, on the other hand, which of the two
systems is better:  in "Western" countries, up to 30% of the work-force is
officially unemployed, and often draws unemployment checks (and maybe food
stamps) without having to make an effort for it, whereas here there is
over-staffing everywhere and unemployed people are "self-employed", which
means they (illegally) sell just about anything you can imagine on the
sidewalks?  Which system gives more dignity to the people, and actually
keeps some unemployed from idling in the streets (and from devising
criminal schemes of making money)?  It would all be nice if only this
over-staffing didn't create an absurd bureaucracy, where even simple
paperwork is cut down into half a dozen transactions to be done by
different agents in opposite parts of the city.

<P>Every second Turk will say he is a businessman, when you ask him.  This
is of course to be understood in broad terms, because even the (illegal)
lighter-fuel seller on the sidewalk considers himself a businessman.
However, I would also say that the average Turk is a very "bad"
businessman!  Let me explain:  most businesses are small, one-person or
one-family affairs, set up in small quarters, and they are happy that way.
Just like in Ottoman times (and in medieval Europe), the shop next door
usually sells/produces exactly the same things:  as long as you know what
part of (the old) town specializes in what, this is a buyer's paradise, as
you just need to "play the competition" to get good prices.  Now, expansion
or merging or buying up the neighbor's shop doesn't seem to come to their
mind:  everybody is fiercely independent, and wants to be his own and the
only boss.  And they don't have a sense of competition:  how many times did
I walk into a grocery, say, to ask for oranges, say, that the grocer said
he ran out of oranges, but that his neighbor had some, and that he would
walk over with me to the neighbor's shop, for a chat!  Back home (in
Europe), the grocer would praise his bananas instead, and not even mention
his neighbor.  This is why I put "bad" between quotes above:  I infinitely
prefer Turkish businessmen to the greedy ones back home!  As an additional
"quirk" of Turkish businessmen, I must add that they are absolute
wrap-o-maniacs:  somehow they only consider things sold when they are
wrapped up in (news)paper, and they won't hear you when you insist on not
having it wrapped up, even if it's just a postcard or a pen.

<H2>Patriotism</H2>

Most Turks are fiercely patriotic, and some will mentally lynch you for the
slightest historical mention that doesn't fit into the way they have been
"brainwashed".  Even some of the intellectual elites, who often spent years
abroad and had access to other viewpoints, can sometimes not be argued with
about certain aspects of their past history.  It's here in Turkey that I
have understood what a powerful tool brainwashing is.  Of course, the books
I have read are not entirely devoid of dogmatism either, but at least I
still have the open-mindedness to listen to all the sides.  The key issues
about which one had better have one's "facts" (if any) together are the
persona of AtatUrk (the first president of the modern republic, and the
object of a much petrified, institutionalized adoration), the "Armenian
genocides", the "Kurdish question", etc.  Especially the four letters K, u,
r, d, in this sequence, make some Turks go ballistic with intolerance:  I
have received some hate mail for having used them a few times in this
diary, although I only used them for geographic and ethnographic
identification, not as a political or separatist statement.

<P>A popular means of airing nationalism are (ball) games of the national
teams or of the top Turkish teams in the European cups.  The national
football team has (deservedly) qualified for the first time for the final
round of the European Championships, but the press splashed such high waves
of nationalism that one was led to believe that the World Championships of
1994 would have to be annulled and replayed so that Turkey could claim its
legitimate World Championship title.  After big victories, raucous crowds
run amok across the entire country, and some foreign residents have felt
threatened by this nationalism.  I haven't really followed crowd behavior
in European arenas recently, but Turkish audiences in international
fixtures strike me as particularly unfair:  every move of the opponent team
is "serenaded" with aggressive booing until they lose the ball.  What is
this?  Why focus energy on being negative, destructive?  A couple years
ago, when Galatasaray (from istanbul) qualified over English champions
Manchester United (not by beating them, just because of more away-goals),
the fans went crazy, and some even staged a demonstration in front of the
UK embassy in Ankara:  don't ask me what football has to do with politics!
Their line was something like that Turkey should be a member of the
European Union because of this qualification.  Politics and sports are not
entirely separated here, and my Brazilian friends will probably point out
that fueling nationalism in sports is just a means of the government to
make the people forget certain problems, at least temporarily...  But I
also have one good word for Turkish football fans:  they write poems for
their favorite teams, and recite them in chorus during the games!

<P>Another way of identifying Turkish nationalists is their childish
refusal to write "Turkey" rather than "TUrkiye" in English sentences.

<P>Turkey, a former political heavyweight (at Ottoman times), has problems
to re-establish its position in the international political arena, and the
knowledge of past military glory creates an utterly useless inferiority
complex (at least for the middle and upper classes, because the lower class
tends to have a superiority complex).  Turkey came out victorious from
their War of In- dependence after World War I, and a proud nation was
built, but it was also torn from its roots by the decision to emulate
Europe and North America.


<H2>Traffic in Turkey</H2>

Even though the driving rules are theoretically the same as in the "West,"
almost nobody sticks to them, and it comes down to mere survival of the
"fittest" on the roads:  the biggest/fastest/most-ruthless has the
priority, wherever he's coming from, at whatever speed he's coming!  (Note
that I can happily write "he" when referring to a driver, because there are
only a few female drivers here, and they tend to be rather considerate.)
Pedestrians thus have the lowest priority, and they are expected to know
that and to be very swift to avoid being run over.  Of course, if you are
used to "Western" courtesy by drivers (although even this is slowly
disappearing in the "West"), then it will really look as if they were
actually <I>trying</I> to run you down!  But such is not the case:  the
drivers are so used to pedestrians getting out of the way in the last
second that they <I>expect</I> it!  So if you don't know the local ad-hoc
"rules" (however strange they may sound to you), you get into these kinds
of situations where you think they are <I>aiming</I> at you.  Actually,
there is only one traffic rule here, and it says:  "There are no other
rules!"

<P>Why do drivers try to kill themselves, their passengers, numerous
pedestrians, and fellow drivers, just to save some time that they will idle
away anyway?!  The traffic directorate has it right when urging drivers not
to be "traffic monsters".  Somehow, brains (if any) seem to get relocated
in testicles while driving.  Put an otherwise very friendly male Turk
behind a steering wheel, and he will turn into an absolute savage,
apparently driving on a testosterone high.  Did anybody ever tell them that
the gas pedal is not an on/off device, but that it actually has
intermediate positions between slow and fast?!  It just beats me what lowly
pleasure one can derive from racing into one's fellow human beings so that
they scatter around like chicken.  You can't overhear the silent screams of
the legions of maimed people who limp around for the rest of their lives,
just for having once failed to cross the street.  As somebody said:
"Westerners" die by accident, Turks live by accident!

<P>Many Turks don't have an idea of what constitutes an acceptable risk:  I
have seen babies crawling on the dashboard of "low-flying" vehicles, buses
and trucks hurtling down curvy descents in neutral speed, a man driving his
motor-bike one-handed, holding his daughter with the other hand, and many
other hair-rising scenes.

<P>We foreigners here in Ankara have discovered what we call the "Critical
Mass Theory (CMT)" (I have observed this in other countries as well):
pedestrians can cross anywhere and anytime, even if they have red lights,
provided they number at least 15 to 20 (according to the width of the road
and the speed of the traffic)!  This always happens spontaneously, without
explicit consent, once the crowd "feels" that the critical mass has been
reached.  Just imagine the chaos, and the angrily honking drivers who know
that such a crowd cannot possibly get out of the way fast enough, i.e.
that they must brake (gasp!).

<P>Another observation is the "Local Space Optimization Principle (LSOP)":
especially when driving, from point A to point B say, Turks seem to be
genetically hardwired to try to move <I>spatially</I> closer to the goal B,
by going to an intermediate point, X say, and then starting all over again.
(Point X is often, but not always, on the straight line between A and B.)
But this goes without anticipating whether the overall <I>time</I> it takes
from A to B via X is optimal, nor whether their move impedes <I>global</I>
traffic.  For instance, if at an intersection someone wants to turn left,
but the left-bound lane has many more vehicles than the right-bound one, he
will queue up in the latter (because that gets him, temporarily!, spatially
closer to the goal), but he will then waste precious time (and run huge
risks) in wheedling through the traffic on the intersection, not to mention
that this slows down everybody (this also goes into the "lack of respect
for each other" category).  Another example is for two-lane roads:  suppose
a pace line of cars on the fast lane (usually the left one) approaches a
creeping truck on the slow lane; if somebody at the rear of the pace line
sees the huge empty space on the slow lane, he will pass, by the LSOP, the
entire pace line on its right, only to get stuck behind the truck until the
entire pace line (including the new arrivals to it!)  has passed it.  A
last example is queuing (ahem, crowding) around a service point:  again,
one is physically closer, but oversight is lost and down the drain goes any
chance for first-come first-served discipline; so they scream and push, and
the fittest will wait less (by lack of respect).  By the way, Turks don't
seem to mind being pushed, having others' elbows or bags shoved onto their
bodies, or, in general, "suffering" from all other forms of useless body
contacts, just because somebody is applying the LSOP.  This of course fits
the "interpersonal distance" theory, which measures the distance people of
various nations want to keep to other people in order to be comfortable.

<P>Elementary Laws of Physics are not believed to apply in Turkey, because
how else can you explain bumper-to-bumper driving in fast pace lines?  Any
open space you keep to your preceding car is considered an "invitation" to
being passed (left or right):  preserving braking distance is thus often
impossible here.  Especially uneducated dolmuS/taxi/truck-drivers have a
very fatalistic approach to driving:  Allah decides on everything anyway,
so why should they bother to drive reasonably?  Since it is all written
anyway, it doesn't come to their mind that they can prolong their lives
(and others' lives) by not entering, from a side-road, at 10km/h and
without looking, onto a trunk road with heavy and fast traffic in both
directions.

<P>Trucks, being often overloaded and incredibly old, creep up hills at
unbelievably slow speeds.  Since there is no enforcement of minimum speed
here, they get away with it, but also produce many silly drive-up
accidents.  Now, if you manage to get enough oxygen and survive the cloud
of choking black exhaust gases around such a creeping truck, you can even
pass it by bike!  This will of course mortally wound the ego of the driver,
so you should pray that he never catches up with you, as he's later bound
to do something fantastically stupid to show you on your little bike who is
the king of the road!

<P>Pedestrians are still unused to bicycle traffic (I'll skip more writing
about drivers being unused to bicycles, as the mere thought gives me the
creeps):  vehicles only exist if they make noise, so you'd better have a
rusty chain and squeaking brakes, as otherwise you'll fork up pedestrians
by the dozen.

<P>Taxi drivers are probably the most-hated fraction of the population, at
least by the foreigners, that is.  Similarly with "dolmuS" drivers.  First,
they honk virtually non-stop in order to drum up business and they
especially like to drive up to foreigners in order to offer rides (is there
a law stating that foreigners are not allowed to walk in Turkey?), and
second, they will happily run over a few pedestrians (potential future
customers!)  just to (un)load another paying passenger.  The best way to
cope with the first problem is to always use the sidewalk that allows you
to walk against the traffic flow, and of course not to gesticulate while
talking to your friends.  The second problem is best avoided by staying
home.  DolmuS drivers are infamous (at least here in Ankara) for other
things as well:  they use opposing lanes as VIP lanes when they are stuck
in a traffic jam, and, every year or so, they widen outskirts boulevards by
an additional lane or so, creating them just by driving through the ditches
until they are leveled!  I can imagine bulldozer-equipped dolmuSes in a
near future...

<P>Not surprisingly, motor sports are relatively unpopular here:  formula
1, Indy, rallye, etc.  races are barely covered by the media, contrary to
the huge audiences these competitions draw in "Western" countries.  And why
should they, as driving yourself to the nearest supermarket gives you
higher thrills than watching a bunch of dudes doing a stock-car race!

<P>I'm endlessly amused when watching Turkish drivers at an intersection.
Here's an account of what happens there:

<OL>

<LI> Getting there.  The width of the road increases (I would like to say
"the number of lanes increases", but I can't, as, for some reason I fail to
understand, they do not create the "line-painter job"), so as to
accommodate drivers who want to turn left or right.  But what happens is
that cars suddenly start wildly swerving around because everybody wants to
be in the shortest queue (by the LSOP):  what would be three lanes back
home will be five to seven queues here.  Moreover, in practice, you can
turn left or right from <I>any</I> lane, and dolmuS drivers seem to make it
a point of honor to turn right from the left-most lane, and
vice-versa!</LI>

<LI> Waiting there.  Cars don't stop <I>before</I> the pedestrian crossing,
nor even <I>on</I> it, but, by the LSOP, as close as they can actually get
to the intersection itself; and if a hole in the other traffic flow allows
it, they'll wheedle in or across!  And you can do this right in front of
the police!  And you are certainly not expected to stop <I>before</I> the
pedestrian crossing:  first, other cars might slam into yours (not
expecting you to be so considerate to crossing pedestrians or to ignore the
LSOP), and second, you'll get a vicious honking concert for doing so.  For
the same reasons, if the crossing traffic is nil or negligible, you'd
better go straight through the red lights.</LI>

<LI> Getting away.  Lights first turn yellow, then green, but by then the
first cars should be up and gone!  Indeed, as soon as the other lights turn
red, that is even before yours turn yellow, the drivers in the back of the
queues start honking nervously to tell the front drivers to get started!
Nobody is annoyed by this:  the front drivers will likely be back drivers
at the next intersection and they will behave exactly in the same way!  So
why do they fall "asleep" when first in a queue, but are staring like
vultures at the lights when not first, so as to literally honk the first
ones out of the intersection?  Honking is however a way of life, and rarely
an insult:  most of the time it is a greeting, or a "gentle reminder" that
traffic lights are about to turn green, or even a "gentle notification"
that you are about to be passed on your right side!  However, the cacophony
is almost unbearable for newcomers to Turkey.</LI>

Well, "bu kadar" (enough for now).  Please keep in mind that this
compilation of impressions is meant to educate "Westerners" about what to
expect when traveling/living in Turkey, but not to vent some (non-existing)
hatred of mine against Turks (otherwise, I wouldn't have stayed here for
three years now).  If, as a side effect, this draws some Turks' attention
to quirks of their nation and society (note that I can write a similar
article on my own people, now that I have spent well over 12 years
abroad!), then I might even have entertained my Turkish readers!
