<H2>Introduction</H2>

This is a report of a trip to Egypt and Jordan, undertaken during
May  1992  by  myself  (from Luxembourg) and my best friend, Marc
(from Belgium).

<P>I have compiled this from my travel notes, often omitting irrelevant
stuff such as where we ate or slept, who was sick with what, how we
organized the getting away from each place, and so on, but adding some
afterthoughts and hindsight.

<P>This journey was totally improvised, reservations - except for flights -
being a concept totally alien to us.  Of course we did some homework
beforehand, so as to know the must-sees.  Valuable information sources were
The Rough Guide on Egypt (UK, sold as Real Guide in North-America; solid
value), the Lonely Planet Travel Survival Kit for Jordan and Syria
(Australia; a great classic, although the 1987 edition is aging badly; we
met the guy working on the update, so stay tuned), and Le Guide du Routard
Egypte, Jordanie, Israel, et Yemen (France; so-so).  Descriptions are kept
informative enough so that those who have been there should recognize the
places, while those who'd like to go there should be able to locate them.
This report is not intended to be a crash course on Ancient Egyptian or
Middle Eastern history.  <P>By the way, <blink>please do not ask any travel
organisation questions to me</blink>, as it's been too long ago that I was
there.

<P>This journey was a shoestring-budget trip, a mattress to crash on and a
shower being all that is needed when constantly on the move.  Round-trip
flights, visas, inoculations, medicine, and souvenirs excluded, we had a
daily maintenance ratio of about $12 each, covering accommodation, food,
drinks, transportation, and (student) entrance fees.  This has to be
relativized though, as Jordan is significantly more expensive - about 30% -
than Egypt.

<P>All views expressed here are mine, and you are the judge whether they
are witty insights, total misunderstandings, or unspeakable truths.
Comments are welcome.

<P>Comments are welcome.

<H1>Part I: EGYPT</H1>

<H2>Day 1: Brussels - Cairo</H2>

Marc and I get to Cairo on separate flights, as we ran into trouble with
our late attempts at finding cheap tickets:  we forgot that low season
implies less flights.  Immigration and customs are pretty straightforward,
though slow.  The visa only costs $15, which is a real bargain compared to
the $35 the Egyptian Embassy in Brussels wanted to charge us.  Declining
all offers for a taxi, we ride a minibus (#27) to downtown Cairo, getting
off at Midan Tahrir (Liberation Square), the pumping heart of Central
Cairo's traffic.  It's 11pm, and many budget hotels are already full.  They
are mostly on the upper floors of office buildings, and after a series of
juddering - suicidal?  - rides in ancient elevators, we eventually spot a
safe haven for the next nights, somewhere on Midan Talaat Harb.


<H2>Day 2: Cairo - Islamic Cairo, Old Cairo, Coptic Cairo</H2>

In the morning, we stroll towards Islamic Cairo, starting our visit with
the Al Azhar Mosque (970), one of the oldest universities in the world, a
stronghold of Sunni orthodoxy, and a hotbed of Egyptian politics.  From its
ramshackle roofs, we enjoy a good view over Cairo.  We also assess how much
this city suffers from air pollution:  one day in Cairo is said to amount
to smoking thirty-five cigarettes.

<P>On Sharia (Street) el-Muski, past Khan el-Khalili, the overtouristed
souk, and into its surroundings, we enter a totally different world.  This
is Marc's first encounter with a medieval, Islamic city-heart:  narrow dirt
roads, shoulder to shoulder crowds, itinerant or squatting street vendors,
music blaring from the tape shops, air filled with incense or spice-scents
here, but stench there, garbage being dropped where it occurs, begging
cripples, deteriorated houses, the odd car insisting on driving through
this labyrinth, men in floating galabias, heavily veiled women, and so on,
mark our every step to the Northern Gates and back.  The people definitely
exhibit a lot of humor and ingenuity.  We shortly peek into Khan
el-Khalili, facing all the tricks of the hustling sellers who try to help
us get rid of our money:  leather jackets, gold and silver jewelry, perfume
essence (that is often diluted in oil), exotic spices (saffron is
incredibly cheap), handicraft (such as mother-of-pearl inlaid cedar-boxes),
and (ugly) T-shirts are on sale here for package tourists.

<P>For dinner, we try fatir (Egyptian pizza) at Fatatri el-Tahrir, and like
it a lot.  At dusk, we walk to the Nile, cross its full width twice on
Tahrir Bridge, and stroll southwards along the corniche, past Roda Island,
through Old Cairo, on our way to Coptic Cairo.  The Copts are orthodox
Christians, and form a 7% minority in Egypt.  A very congenial atmosphere
reigns here, and we simply enjoy the street-life, rather than focus on the
various churches or convents.  A wedding is being celebrated on a sideroad.
Weddings are quite a thing in Egypt.  The bride and groom, dowry and gifts
are on display, while music, singing, hand-clapping, and the women's
ululations provide the auditive background.

<P>Eventually we spot the subway station, and head back to Midan Tahrir,
while a young Copt gives us - in fluent French - an enthusiastic crash
course on his people and religion.

<H3>Traffic</H3>

There is a maddening traffic around the clock. A  total  lack  of
discipline  and  global thinking by drivers and pedestrians alike
creates one merry  traffic  jam  after  the  other,  turning  the
streets  into  an open-air hooting cacophony, where light-shows - 
oops, traffic lights - are  merely  decorative.  Crossing  streets
resembles  a  kamikaze  trip, but foreigners soon get the hang of
elegantly weaving, lane by  lane,  across  streets.  It  actually
turns out to be quite safe, as drivers are alert, and speeding is
difficult anyhow. Donkey or horse-drawn carts  are  frequent,  as
well  as  (motor)cyclists.  I saw an old man riding his bike onehanded, while balancing a huge tray of breads on  his  head,  and
negotiating in perfect serenity a difficult crossing.

<P>Riding a bus can be a quite harrowing experience, unless you get on, and
leave, at terminals.  First, bus-drivers merely slow down at stops.  And
it's amazing to see even elder people jump on or off.  Second, Egyptians
have this funny game of trying to board a bus before passengers can get
off.  It's not uncommon to do so across windows, or where windows should
be, so legs are often seen dangling around.  Last, these buses must have
been operating since the Middle Ages, and you find yourself praying that
you won't fall through the floor, into the engine or onto the road.

<P>Riding a taxi is the ultimate experience, transforming Disney World's
Space Mountain into a kindergarten attraction.  Special taxis, operating
within towns, make you feel as if in the middle of the 500 Miles of
Indianapolis.  Service taxis, operating on fixed routes between
agglomerations, tend to speed on the opposing lane, oblivious of the
dangers that blind curves might entail.

<P>Strange, isn't it, that these people are the most relaxed you can
imagine, and yet turn into monsters once behind a steering wheel.  At
night, many people drive with parking lights only, but switch on their
high-beams when encountering cars or other obstacles.  We tried to figure
out what the rules were for hooting.  It's definitely not to say
"Asshole!", but rather to say "Watch out, I'm coming!".  Many people
outside urban areas are totally untrained to coping with traffic, and cross
without looking.  Some drivers mechanically hoot every n seconds, even in
the absence of potential dangers.


<H2>Day 3: Cairo - Old Cairo</H2>

We set off where we left yesterday, from Coptic Cairo's subway station.
Past Amr's Mosque (641), we stroll along the Fustat, the original Islamic
Cairo, which today looks as if the Egyptians had performed some nuclear
experiments there, and where the unfortunate sift through Cairo's garbage
for edible or recyclable material.  On to the Southern Cemetery, which is
actually inhabited by hundreds of thousands of poor people.  Street-wise
kids accompany us, and we teach them English words in exchange for lessons
in Arabic.  Some adults think we are being pestered by these kids and try
to chase them away, although we insist that we appreciate their company.
Next, we climb onto the Citadel (1176) with its imposing Mohammad Ali
Mosque (1830), for another smog-laden view over Cairo.  Across Midan Salah
al-Din, and between the Sultan Hassan Mosque (1362) and Rifai Mosque, we
head back to our hotel.

<P>Most tourists only come to Cairo because of the museums, the pyramids,
and at best a few mosques.  But there is much more to it:  although
sometimes nerve-racking, Cairo is a fascinating oriental city, with still
one foot in the Middle Ages.  After a while, mosques and palaces all look
alike anyway, so just walk off the beaten path and you'll discover a wealth
of interesting details.  Watch the people, possibly talk to them.  Cairenes
are very friendly, good-natured, despite the often depressing
circumstances.  It speaks a lot for them that quarrels actually never get
really started, because passersby or friends are always quick to temper bad
moods.

<P>We spend the evening with Dina, a friend of mine from my stay in the
USA, who has recently moved back to Egypt.  She takes us out to the Al
Omdah Restaurant, in Mohandiseen, for a delicious kushari dinner (rice,
macaroni, lentils, and a spicy tomato sauce) complemented by the usual
appetizers (hummus, tahina, and babaghanoush dips, plus torshi, that is
pickled carrots) plus some great pastry for desert.  All together for a
ridiculous price, showing us how badly we have been overcharged so far.

<H3>Queuing</H3>

British discipline addicts must die of heart-strokes in Egypt.  As said
earlier, boarding a bus precedes unboarding, and both require considerable
skill and strength.  Even in banks, or at customs, the unwary are merrily
skipped over from all sides, and most clerks don't give a damn whose turn
it actually is.  So you have to be quite aggressive within queues that
actually look more like crowds:  the one who shouts loudest will be served
next.  Don't even consider leaving a polite gap to ensure the
confidentiality of your predecessor's operation.  Women have absolute
priority, if not separate queues, although foreign women have to be
assertive to use this privilege.


<H2>Day 4: Cairo - Saqqara - Giza - Cairo</H2>

"Was it worth the trouble getting to Saqqara?"  (it's about 30km south of
Cairo), somebody asked me later.  "No", I replied, "but the trouble getting
there was worth it!".  Let me explain why.  In order to avoid the scalping
taxi-drivers, who might furthermore rush us through the sites, we decide to
use public transportation to get to Saqqara.  Thus a subway ride to Helwan,
the southern terminal, then a minibus to the Nile, a ferry to its west bank
(where the sun sets, thus the right side for a necropolis), a stroll to el
Badrashein, a minibus to Saqqara village, and a small baksheesh (tip) to
the driver to drop us a few km further on, at the gate to the North Saqqara
necropolis.  This timeconsuming and awkward approach overshadows a thousand
times the actual site.  Indeed, wherever we appear, dozens of kids cloud
around us, and we feel like being the first-ever travelers getting to these
places.  Many people just want to talk to us, and our few words of Arabic
come in very handy.  Near the ferry, some women come surprisingly close to
us, apparently eager for a chat, but then the menfolk chase them away,
probably in a token gesture to preserve everybody's honor?  They express
disbelief that we might be interested in talking to such worthless
creatures...

<P>We visit the site only very briefly, as most things are in total ruins,
if not closed.  Only the famous 60m high Step Pyramid - built by Imhotep -
on Zoser's Funerary Complex is worth it, plus the fine views to the
pyramids in South Saqqara and Giza.  That's where we head to in a taxi.
The road goes through a paradisiacal countryside, the Nile "oasis".

<P>A host of camel-drivers assault us while we approach the big three
pyramids of Cheops, Chephren, and Mykerinos, but we shake them off with our
indifference to their pleas.  The Sphinx - under repair - is much smaller
(20m) than it looks like on most (carefully angled) pictures.  It's hot
today, and the crowds are large, so we relax in the shade of the Chephren
Pyramid (136.5m), the one with the intact summit, and that actually looks
taller than its neighbor.  Marc is eventually conned into a camel-ride
around the pyramids.  Why not?  After all, sooner or later you've got to
try this anyhow.  We have to forget our pledge to climb onto the Cheops
Pyramid (140m), not because it's forbidden (some rules have been invented
so that baksheesh can bend them), but because it is very steep after all,
and we both suffer from vertigo even after the first few steps.
Unfortunately, all pyramids are closed in addition.  In the early evening,
we shoot the few classical pictures.  A bus (#901) gets us back to downtown
Cairo.

<P>After a Chinese dinner at Fu Ching's, we stroll on Sharia Talaat Harb,
where elegant young Cairenes do endless window shopping at the fashion
shops.  Selling shoes must be the most difficult business here, as dozens
of look-alike shops compete for customers.

<H3>Egyptian women</H3>

Egyptian women are a difficult issue for a foreigner.  At first sight, if
Western society is over-sexed, then Middle Eastern society is under-sexed.
Especially in rural areas, little girls are dressed up like beauty queens,
in colorful dresses, until puberty.  Then, according to religious beliefs
and social standing of their parents, they disappear under the hijab (veil)
and heavy black chadors, or simply cover their hair with head scarves.  I
ignore to what extent women have disapproved, and do disapprove, of this
condition.  But I have noticed that the more "adventurous" among them, even
some with veils, are quite flirtatious when travelers turn their heads at
them, and they know very well how to "seduce" a man with a smile, a look, a
sexy walk.  These things are inherent to women, and can't be bred away by
centuries of veil-wearing.  It even seems that veils are mentioned nowhere
in the Qur'an.

<P>Islamic society is very safe for women, as rape or sexual harassment are
little-known crimes.  Women have separate quarters in mosques, subways, and
so on, and have priority in queues.  They don't seem used to gallantry, and
are embarrassed when you hold doors open, or sidestep onto the road to let,
say, a pregnant woman pass by.

<P>At least in public, men often treat (their) women with total
indifference, if not shocking disdain, at least for Western standards.  I
guess and hope, though, that in the intimacy of a household, a man shows
more respect to his wife, and treats her as more than just a baby-breeder
and house-maid?

<P>There is little open courtship, and arranged marriages still prevail in
rural areas.  But love is a recurring theme in music, poetry, and movies:
there is an abundance of habibi (darling) in lyrics.  Maybe love is just a
pre-marital fantasy, but not an ingredient of marriage, which is rather
seen as a social contract to get along with each other?  I don't know.

<P>Egyptian women are very beautiful, even if you often have to judge from
their eyes only.  These eyes...!  So one might argue that's one good reason
to veil them, as there will be no temptation.  OK, but what about the
women's perspective on this "solution" to male craving?!  And who invented
belly-dancing, this highly erotic entertainment?  Although it seems that
this is rather inauthentic, as developed entirely for satisfying Western
fantasies about the Orient.  Contradictions?

<P>Muslim women are expected to be virgins at their wedding, but men are
not.  So guess who's paying the price for all this suppressed sexuality of
young (male) Muslims?  Female tourists, of course, who have to cope with
blunt invitations, fondling, and grabbing (see below).  Next, (purely
sexual) male homosexuality seems rampant as well, judging from proposals we
had to reject.  Somebody confided to me that some young divorcees and
widows are "available" for quickies.  And adultery is not as unusual as one
might believe, according to other sources.  Lastly, prostitution is very
much alive, though usually not on the tourist circuit.  After all, a pretty
"normal" society, eh?


<H2>Day 5: Cairo - Egyptian Antiquities Museum; Cairo - ...</H2>

We spend the whole morning exploring every single room of the Egyptian
Antiquities Museum.  It's fabulous, though exhausting, as every object
comes in at least twenty different versions.  And the crowds are obnoxious
too, though some groups are guided by gorgeous young Egyptian women, whose
explanations we listen to while admiring them, rather than the objects.
Other highlights are the Tut-Ankh-Amon collection, the mummy room,
pyramidions, sarcophagi, chariots, and various exquisite statues.

<P>The afternoon is spent on some souvenir hunting, plus grocery shopping
for the forthcoming train ride.  After checking out of our hotel, we head
for the Ramses Railway Station.  What looks like a relic from Death on the
Nile times on track #11 actually turns out to be our train to Aswan.
Trains are dirt-cheap in Egypt, so we afford a 1st class ticket (LE26,
including a 35% student reduction) for the 900km haul to Aswan.  The
carriage has A/C, and only 1+2 armchairs in each row, but it is very dusty.
No overbooking, and we actually leave on time.  It's late, and we try to
make ourselves comfortable for the night.  I manage to sleep on the ground,
under the sofas, so as to stretch out fully, while Marc stretches out
across our facing sofas.  The ride is juddering and noisy, and the mere
fact that the seats are not bolted to the floor gives me the creeps when
considering the consequences of sharp braking, or, even worse, of a
crash...

<H3>The pros and cons of being from a small country</H3>

As a native of Luxembourg, you'd consider that you can happily announce
where you're from, because absolutely nobody can pretend disliking the
foreign policy of your country.  Right so.  But, on the other hand, it's
amazing how many doors you close by being honest about such origins:  most
people won't know what or where your country is, and thus don't know where
to start the conversation.  "Feyn?"  (Where?)  "Ana min Luxemburg."  (I'm
from Luxembourg.)  "?", and they drop you like a hot potato, turning to the
more "interesting" guests from imperialistic powers like the USA, England,
France, or Germany.  Marc has less problems with Belgium, mainly because of
some Belgian soccer stars, so whenever I feel like it will help, I overcome
my national pride, and also pretend to be a Belgian.  At other times
though, you're quite happy to state that you're from Luxembourg, namely
when you're stuck in one of these business-oriented discussions, starting
with a question about your origins.  If the answer is that people from
there are good, even when you pretend being from Disneyland, Lichtenburg,
or Finmark, and that they have a brother there, then say good-bye.


<H2>Day 6: ... - Aswan</H2>

We breakfast on our delicious pastry, plus peanuts, and order tea from the
steward.  The country-side is very interesting to watch from the train, as
we go through the fellaheen (farmer) villages, pastures, and fields of the
Nile valley.  Everything is ingeniously irrigated, and a lush green color
dominates the scenery.  Many houses proudly feature hadj (pilgrimage to
Mekka) paintings, depicting the journey, the seven circuits around the
Kaaba, the kissing of the Holy Stone, the praying near the Mount of Mercy,
the drinking of water from the wells of Zamzam, the sacrificial killing of
a sheep, and other rites.

<P>We make friends with the US couple from across the corridor, Susan and
Steve.  They've been on the move, all across Asia, for a full year now,
escaping the recession, and are fun to talk to.  There also is an Egyptian
engineer, who is very nice to us, but shy to use his few words of English.

<P>Of course, the train is late, only 3 hours though, but we eventually get
to Aswan in the late afternoon.  It's still very hot, and the various
travelers have no trouble locating hotel rooms in this low season, where
heavy discounts are available.  After a well-deserved shower to wipe off
the dust, we stroll to the Nile corniche, arguably the best in Egypt:
Elephantine Island, Kitchener Island, and the various funerary monuments on
the west bank offer a great panorama, not to speak about the elegant
feluccas (sailing boats) gliding noiselessly over the Nile.  Caleche and
taxi drivers, felucca captains, and various other con-men are very anxious,
if not aggressive, for business.  But we soon figure out the correct
prices, and sign up at Hotel Marwa's trips for the next few days.

<H3>Spelling</H3>

When crafting signs or pamphlets for tourists, in both an alphabet and a
language alien to them, Egyptians often don't bother to ask native English
speakers about correct spelling.  The results are sometimes very funny
phonetic approximations of their intentions.  Here's a sample assortment:
"buisenes" for "business", "hotle" for "hotel", "pitsa" for "pizza", and so
on.  Most words seem to be Arabic-to-Latin alphabet transcriptions of what
the Arabic spelling would be.  But this can't work since some sounds are
missing.  For instance, the "p" is absent, and often turns into a "b".
Especially my first name, Pierre, seems unpronounceable to most.  Too bad I
didn't know that Boutros (like the Coptic UN Secretary-General) does the
job perfectly well.


<H2>Day 7: Aswan - Kitchener Island, Elephantine Island</H2>

Captain Hassan and his aide take us (for LE10 each) on a half-day cruise to
Aswan's landmarks on his felucca called Pyramid.  Kitchener Island -
"given" to the same-named British ConsulGeneral in reward for his exploits
in the Sudan War - features a beautiful Botanical Garden with trees and
flowers from all over the world, plus a colorful bird life.

<P>On the west bank, we visit the Agha Khan Mausoleum, where the 48th Imam
of the Isma'ili Shi'ites is buried, while his caring widow, the Begum,
makes sure that a fresh rose is deposited on his tomb every day.  Due to
the heat, and the wealth of things to see in coming days, we decide not to
hike over to the St.  Simeon Monastery, nor the tombs even further beyond,
and we get back to our felucca.

<P>On Elephantine Island - so called because of the smooth, round, dark
rocks lying around, looking like bathing elephants - we have a look at the
Nubian Museum (which features a skull featuring proven traces of live
surgery, or trepanation), the Nilometer, and the ruins of the fabled Yebu
town.  Whoever delivered the building permit for the Oberoi Hotel, and
whoever designed this airport-tower-like horror marring the spectacular
beauty of the north end of this island, should be posthumously issued a
fatwa (sentence of death).

<P>The rest of the day is spent in laziness, and at dinner we meet our two
US-ians again.  They too are eager for a longer felucca cruise, and we give
them the coordinates of Hotel Marwa so that they sign up for the same trip
as ours.  Just four more people like these two, and we should have a
perfectly blended team.  Insh'Allah (if God wants).

<H3>Time</H3>

Most Egyptians are without notion of time.  No wonder, as little has
changed over the millennia, and all that mattered was the Nile's behavior.
So it comes as little surprise that foreigners clash with locals over
temporal issues.  For instance, at the telephone office, when you want to
place a domestic long-distance call, the clerk lets you wait for 1.5 hours,
and yet tells you happily that he tried once when you enquire about why you
don't get the call.  Or on a ferry whose departure is being delayed by 6
hours, although it is already boarded, and people have to sit it out in the
blazing sunlight, nobody complains.  Malesh (never mind).  Fatalism is
king.  Bukra (tomorrow) is another favorite when things don't realize as
expected.  So don't even ask about times, as Egyptian minutes are very
flexible:  if they say a walk takes 5 minutes, be prepared for a 30 Western
minutes hike; if a physician tells you on the phone he will be right there
in a few minutes, you'd better not be in a serious condition.  The same
holds by the way for Egyptian kilometers:  they range anything in between
0.2 and 5 Western kilometers.


<H2>Day 8: Aswan - Abu Simbel - High Dam - Philae - Aswan</H2>

A short night, as we have to get up at 3:30am.  Cramped into a minibus with
eight other travelers, we have a boring 3.5hr ride south, across the
desert, to Abu Simbel.  At the edge of Lake Nasser (created by the High
Dam, see below), two rock-hewn temples were here salvaged by the UNESCO in
1968, when the rising waters threatened to drown this monumental site.
Ramses II (1304-1237 BC) had these majestic temples erected at the south
entrance to Egypt, so as to show the might of the Egyptian nation to
anybody (Nubians,...)  coming in from there.  So the temple complex was cut
into pieces, and reassembled some 61m higher.  The great Sun Temple,
depicted on the LE1 bank-note, has a facade dominated by four 20m high
enthroned colossi of Ramses II.  The Hypostele Hall and Sanctuary within
the mountain are pretty impressive, too.  The smaller Hathor Temple of
Queen Nefertari, his favorite wife, features two statues of Nefertari, each
between two statues of Ramses II himself.  We also peek behind the setup,
namely the False Mountain.  Across Lake Nasser, we can see the Sudan.

<P>Another long bus-ride back, but in the scorching sun now.  We stop for
tea somewhere in the desert where the Tropic of Cancer is supposed to pass.
Visiting the High Dam turns out to be a rip-off as we actually have to pay,
and as it is not interesting at all, except maybe for the Soviet-built
heroic-socialist-realist monuments of fraternity.  It is heavily guarded by
military commandos and anti-aircraft missiles:  a dam burst would wash 45
million people into the Mediterranean Sea.  Completed in 1971, this dam
created the 6,000 sqkm Lake Nasser, stretching well into the Sudan.  Its
benefits - regulation of the Nile, electricity, more cultivated land, more
harvests, more rain - are said to outweigh its drawbacks - need for
fertilizers, appearance of bilharzia.  The great losers were the 120,000
Nubians, whose entire land has been submerged by Lake Nasser, and who
subsequently had to be relocated, within Egypt as well as to the Sudan
(which is bad luck, because of the drought and civil war).

<P>Marc and I get off the minibus at the east end of the Old Dam (1902),
and head to the motorboat dock.  We split a ride with an elder Dutch pair
to get to Philae Island, where the rescued Temple of Isis is awaiting us.
This one is especially bewitching.

<P>It's very hot (40+C) by now.  What kind of heroes come to these places
in July or August, considering that the difference between 40C and 50C is
exponentially worse than the one between 30C and 40C?

<P>Eventually, we head back to Aswan, storming the Aswan Moon's bar for a
cold Stella beer.  We're down to two meals per day, breakfast and dinner,
because organizing lunch is tricky with all those visits.  But our bodies
easily accommodate to this diet, as it would be difficult anyhow to eat
much when the weather is so hot.

<P>In the early evening, we again meet Susan and Steve, on their way to
Hotel Marwa for the final agreements on the felucca cruise.  We meet
Roseanne (Canada) and her boyfriend Alan (Australia), who also sign up for
the trip, and who blend in perfectly.  Two Germans are announced to
complete the team.

<P>After dinner, we meet the Egyptian engineer who was on the train with
us:  he invites us for some hot kerkadeh drinks (Hibiscus infusion) with
friends of his, and helps us on souvenir shopping in the souks.  What a
nice chap.  He is so eager to assist us that he gives us all his addresses
and phone-numbers in Egypt, so that we contact him in case of trouble, and
he would join us if need be.

<H3>Children</H3>

Egyptians love (their) children, and they treasure family life in a way
long-forgotten in the Western world.  In the evenings, you see fathers
loading up to five small kids onto their motor-bikes for a ride around
town.  Children are all over, helping their parents, raising the younger
kids, doing odd jobs in the streets, crowding around travelers.  Some want
baksheesh, pens, or candy, while others try to sell you handicraft they
designed themselves, such as dolls made from rags, cobras made from grass,
and so on.  Those in touch with tourists often have a useful babbling of
English, and it can be quite fun to spend some time with them.  Indeed,
after some smiles and greetings in Arabic, most forget what they initially
wanted from you.  Some critics say that birth control is a must for Egypt,
as its population gains one million every nine months.


<H2>Day 9: Aswan - ...</H2>

Dagmar and Thomas, the two Germans, indeed complement our homogenous group
very well.  Just before setting off, we have the crazy idea of taking
Stella beer along.  This amounts to a major intelligence act in a Muslim
country, where beer is mostly available from bars only, which of course
sell only at exorbitant prices.  But after a long chain of friends'
friends, a taxi-driver organizes a crate of twenty 1l bottles, at the
reasonable cost of LE5 each, including the various bribes.

<P>The Sea Serpent is a beautifully arranged felucca, complete with
sunroof, and mattresses across the planks, under which we stow our
backpacks.  Captain Hegazi and his aide Mohammad are great chaps, too,
speaking English reasonably well.  Both are Nubians, well-used to Western
ways, and self-effacing, doing their jobs quietly, expertly, and
efficiently.  Last but not least, they have a tape-deck.  The 3-day-cruise
costs only LE35 each, plus LE20 each for food and mineral water.

<P>Tacking along, we sail downstream (north), against the wind, which
always blows south:  this involves a zigzag course, where every zig is a
slow crossing of the Nile perpendicular to a bank, and every zag is a
swift, long diagonal ride to the other bank.  This is of course the
ultimate lazy experience.  We get to know each other.  We read and exchange
our books and magazines.  We play cards.  We doze on the mattresses.  We
take sun-baths.  We listen to our tapes (Nubian, al Jeel, Rai, Western).
We picnic on bananas and on sandwiches with falafel, eggs, tuna, feta
cheese, and tomatoes.  We drink an occasional cool Stella that we retrieve
from the Nile-borne basket.  Steve ties himself to the boat and body-surfs
behind it at full speed during a zag.  Everything is completely quiet,
except for the Diesel pumps that replace ageold irrigation wheels, and the
occasional cruise-boat.

<P>At dusk, we tie up the boat for the night.  A great kushari dinner is
prepared.  It's still extremely hot, and mosquitoes are swarming all over
the place.  Why didn't I buy a net?  The night promises to be a sweatbox
experience worsened by those little beasts.

<H3>Drinks</H3>

Shaey (tea), kerkadeh (Hibiscus infusion), and ahwa (Turkish coffee) are
the main drinks.  There also is a great variety of fruit juices (lemon,
orange, mango, and so on), often served ice-cold.  These drinks are very
healthy, especially good for your stomach, because best-adapted to local
conditions of temperature and hygiene.  Tea houses are great hangouts if
you want to watch the local menfolk:  they gather here for the occasional
drink, read the newspaper, exchange gossip, and discuss politics, play
tawla (backgammon) or cards, smoke the charcoal-fired sheesha (waterpipe).
Egyptians drink tap water, or sometimes straight off the Nile, but
foreigners had better stick to bottled mineral water (such as Baraka).
Western soft-drinks are very popular, too:  Pepsi, Fanta, Sport Cola,...,
and some local imitations (Teem, Mirinda,...)  dominate the market.
Surprisingly Coca Cola is not very present, and the legend goes that they
lost their marketshare because of a rumor accusing their drink of
containing porcine substances.  Alcohol is forbidden by Islam, though
readily available:  most countries brew their own beer (since Pharaonic and
Assyrian times), and produce their own wines, in addition to all Western
imports.  Heavy-duty liquors are available duty-free to foreign guests
during one month, so Egyptians eager to spice up their parties ask you to
help them out.


<H2>Day 10: ... - Kom Ombo - ...</H2>

At 6am, Captain Hegazi unties the boat, and lets it drift with the current.
I wake up while he prepares breakfast, and silently slip to the front deck,
where Thomas soon joins me, and we enjoy a first cup of tea with Hegazi.
We soon understand why he didn't set sail:  there is no wind.  So we
advance extremely slowly today.

<P>Mid-morning, we dock near the temple complex of Kom Ombo, right on the
Nile:  what a gorgeous approach.  The Temple of Haroeris and Sobek is
interesting, especially since leftovers of original paint can be found all
over.

<P>The remainder of the day goes by in slow-motion, some telegraph pole
being visible all the time.  The heat grows oppressive, and the flies are
very obnoxious.  At dusk, Captain Hegazi estimates that we covered an
impressive 20km today, as opposed to the 40km yesterday in 5 hours less
time.

<H3>Garbage and recycling</H3>

Garbage is being dropped where it occurs.  Trash cans are rarely found,
except maybe on temple sites.  Whole armies of blue-coated men are
constantly sweeping the roads, removing the accumulating trash, as well as
fighting a Sisyphus battle against the sand.  Most travelers are extremely
conscious about not spoiling the landscape with their trash, for instance
by asking their felucca captains not to dump everything in the Nile.  But
what guarantee do we have that they don't do so after we've turned our
backs?  You can see many people sifting through the garbage, looking for
food leftovers and recyclable material.  Yes, Egypt must be a top-ranked
recycling nation in the world, as literally everything is re-used or
recycled.  Dagmar showed us a nice flower made of...  chocolate wrappings.


<H2>Day 11: ... - ...</H2>

Although mosquito-ridden, the night is pleasantly cool, and we all sleep
well.  Thomas again joins me on the deck, while the boat already drifts
downstream.  After breakfast, the wind picks up, and we efficiently tack
north at full speed, past Silsilah, the ancient quarries for the
necropoles.

<P>When we dock in Edfu at 5pm, we actually almost match our initial
schedule, though the local temple complex is closed by now.  So only Dagmar
gets off, since she has to be in Cairo tomorrow evening to meet her sister.
As Edfu itself looks pretty uninviting, Captain Hegazi offers us to sail
downstream with him and Mohammad, to some island on the river, and spend
the night there instead.  Agreed.

<H3>Western women</H3>

Many Egyptian men seem to have strange ideas about Western women.  Of
course, from their point of view, a woman traveling alone, or in a (mixed
or not) group, can only be lose, and thus easy prey.  Garb is actually
irrelevant, most female travelers conclude:  whether modestly clothed from
neck to ankles, or in T-shirt plus shorts, they collect the same blunt
declarations like "I want to f*ck you".  Only boyfriends acting as
husbands, or (fake) wedding rings in the absence of a (would-be) husband,
can make them look respectable, if at all.  They complain about grabbing
and fondling in crowded areas.  Though it must be said that a sharp
reaction usually attracts the sympathy of passersby who scorn the offender.
Some young Egyptians got it all wrong by thinking that Western women are at
any male's every whim:  they asked us how to proceed, and how much money
was currently needed to pay a random girl for a quickie.  That only
prostitutes do it for money, and that sluts are rather the exception, and
that it's often love that links sex partners, were totally strange ideas to
them.

<P>So imagine these three women and five men on that felucca:  what wild
orgies they must be having every night.  So, not unsurprisingly, whenever
we dock for spending the night, the whole menfolk of the nearest village
crowds the banks, sitting on their heels, and staring at us for hours.  The
girls have difficulties changing their clothes when the nights become
cooler, and you can literally hear the eyes pop out of some heads.  Same
with nature's calls.  Jane, a Kiwi, later told me that a fellah once showed
her a 1.5m high mud-brick circle where she could relieve herself.
Gratefully she stepped in, and in the midst of "delivering" a diarrhea, saw
a dozen adult men staring at her.  She forgot to ask for baksheesh for this
peepshow...  Hallas, imshee (stop it, go away)!  These things are
unthinkable with the local women.


<H2>Day 12: ... - Edfu - Luxor</H2>

Back to Edfu at 8am, we disembark, but not after a hearty farewell to
Mohammad and Hegazi, for whom we write an enthusiastic letter of
recommendation.  The Horus Temple complex is superbly preserved, and
overshadows everything seen so far, except Abu Simbel.  We split a service
taxi to Luxor, and all check in at the Grand Hotel, a famous travelers'
haunt, recommended to us by the Hotel Marwa staff.

<P>The rest of the day is spent on strolling around Luxor:  the temple
downtown, though impressive, can almost entirely be eyevisited from the
outside.  One of its twin obelisks is today adorning the Place de la
Concorde in Paris.  The souks are quite lively and colorful, so that's
where we hang around most of the time.  Suddenly, in a totally untouristed
area, a man invites us for tea.  Juma, a Nubian, is a tailor, and insists
that he is not interested in money, which is usually a bad sign.  He sounds
honest, though, and lectures us on his philosophy of life.  We accept an
invitation for tomorrow's dinner with his family.  But at times, he is very
weird.

<H3>Music</H3>

Egyptians are crazy about music.  Tape stalls, often selling pirate copies,
are all over, and you hear - endure?  - the current smash hits many times
every day.  On our trip, it is Hakim - a proponent of al Jeel, a modern
urban music including elements of disco and rap, like Algerian Rai - whose
album is best-selling, even among tourists.  Lu-lulu-lu-lulu and
Lucky-Lucky-Luck (phonetic approximations) are omnipresent in our minds.
Few people seem to listen to more classical Arab music, but they absolutely
love you for identifying Umm Kulthum, Mohammad Abdel Wahab, Farid
el-Atrache, or Fairuz on the radio.


<H2>Day 13: Luxor - Theban Necropolis - Karnak - Luxor</H2>

In order to beat the crowds and the heat, we ride our rented bikes to the
Nile in order to catch the first locals' ferry at 6am.  Once on the west
bank, we cycle across interesting fellaheen street-life to the student
ticket office, just across the Colossi of Memnon.  These are 20m high,
heavily withered twin statues sitting amidst corn fields.  We purchase
tickets for the Tombs of the Nobles only, but first cycle out to Deir
el-Bahri where we view the famous Hatshepsut Temple from a distance,
because it's under heavy restoration, and the two upper levels are closed.

<P>On to the Tombs of the Nobles, set in limestone hills amidst a village.
Young girls insist on selling us their dolls made from rags, then on giving
them to us a gifts, because they "like" us.  The tombs themselves are a
heavily underrated destination, and we examine the following with great
care:  Nakht (#52), Ramose (#55), Userhat (#56), Khaemhat (#57), Menna
(#69), Sennofer (#96), and Rekhmire (#100).  The artwork includes paintings
on stucco featuring earthly life and its continuation in the hereafter.
The paint looks so incredibly well-preserved that we almost ask the
guardians, who reflect the sunlight into the tombs with mirrors, when the
paint last got refreshed.

<P>It's not too hot yet, so we scoot around the Ramesseum (mortuary temple
of Ramses II) and Medinet Habu (mortuary temple of Ramses III).  Both are
heavily deteriorated, so we only view them from the outside, as more
spectacular temples are on our program:  we've become quite greedy after
Edfu.  Near a well, we spot some women desperately trying to help their
donkeys pull the carts with water-barrels onto the road, but to no avail as
the slope is too steep.  So we dismount our bikes, and help them.  They are
very grateful:  shokran (thanks), and we move on saying afwan (our
pleasure).

<P>Back to Luxor at 11am, we have an early lunch at the excellent New
Karnak Restaurant.  Then luck is on our side when it turns out that the
Luxor Museum is open in the evenings only.  Indeed we decide to cycle on to
Karnak then, and despite the by now oppressive heat, we're bound to have
the time of our live there.  There is almost nobody else on the site:  it's
lunchtime for package tours.  For almost 3 hours, we walk in total awe
around the magnificence and leviathan grandeur of the Precinct of Amun.
The Great Hypostele Hall with its dense forest of over a hundred 23m high,
15m round columns is so overwhelming that we have to sit down to take it
all in.  This is where James Bond (Roger Moore) and Anya Amasova (Barbara
Bach) have their titanic fight with the steeltoothed killer in The Spy Who
Loved Me.  Temples, pylons, obelisks (one in Rome now), courtyards, and
hieroglyphics galore.  But eventually, many package tours start flocking
in, destroying the spirit of the place, and we cycle home via the Avenue of
Sphinxes.

<P>In the evening, we pick up Juma at his store, and head to his home for
the promised dinner.  It's a cozy, clean place, and his 4-year-old son
Mohammad is a quite happy and lively lad.  We're only shortly allowed to
greet his wife, who is self-effacingly preparing the food in the kitchen,
while breast-feeding the baby.  After the great kushari dinner, Juma
proudly shows us his many family pictures, plus photos taken by other
travelers he has treated to dinner.  But then the discussion again turns
sour, around medicine stones, an expensive pomade for Thomas' knee, buying
whiskey, and so on.  We gracefully withdraw, after complimenting the wife
on her great cuisine.

<H3>Package tourists</H3>

Package tourists were our big plight.  I know many people whom I can't
imagine going to a place like Egypt without a fullyorganized tour.  So such
tours apparently serve their purpose, because Egypt is rightfully a top
tourist destination in the world.  But it remains a mystery to me how these
people can go home afterwards, and pretend having seen Egypt.  Shipped
around in A/C buses, trains, and boats, bedded in 3+* hotels, driven like
flocks of sheep across museums and sites, with no time to linger over
details and no option to decide on their own priorities, dropped into the
most throat-cutting souks, dined on inappropriate Western cuisine, how can
they pretend enjoying it, or even knowing anything about contemporary
Egypt?  Indeed, most look incredibly bored, and don't even listen to their
guides:  I overheard a guide differentiating two deities in some tomb, and
testing her group in the next tomb, but nobody could distinguish both gods
anymore.  Some seem more interested in the lonely widow, who in turn has a
crush on the guide, who actually has an eye on somebody's beautiful
17-year-old daughter running around in provocative mini-skirts and tight
T-shirts.  Package tourists should be given more freedom, and somebody
should hand them a pamphlet on money-spending (see below), modest dressing,
and so on, which they have to pass a test on in order to be admitted on the
tour.


<H2>Day 14: Luxor - Theban Necropolis - Luxor</H2>

Up early again, we walk this time to the Nile ferry.  On the other side, we
hail a taxi to the Valley of the Kings.  The three most famous tombs
(Ramses VI, Seti I, Tut-Ankh-Amun) are closed:  malesh.  So we decide on
Ramses III (#11), which is said to be a fair consolation price when Seti I
is closed.  Almost 30m long, this over 3,000-year-old tomb features the
classical excerpts from the Books of the Dead.  Our next choice is
Amenophis II (#35), one of the deepest tombs, and hence with suffocating
air.  This 3,500-year-old tomb has a right-angled layout, and even features
defences against grave-robbers, such as a pit and a false burial chamber.
The quartzite sarcophagus is still there, and other than the original
mummy, nine others were found here:  they got stashed here as their
original tombs turned out unsafe.  The last pick - we bought three
wildcards - is Horemheb (#57), which is quite interesting due to its
unfinished state:  indeed, the deeper you proceed, the more the paintings
actually turn into stick-figure drawings, showing how the artists proceeded
in their decoration work.

<P>The afternoon is spent in laziness.  We then have a look at the
interesting displays of the Luxor Museum.  After dinner, over a good beer,
we bid good-bye to Thomas, who will be leaving early tomorrow morning for
the Siwa Oasis.

<H3>Walking</H3>

There must be a law stating that tourists are not allowed to walk.  Indeed,
it gets very annoying if you have to explain a zillion times a day that you
don't need a taxi, caleche, or felucca ride:  la, shokran (no, thank you).
Also, many locals can't understand why a traveler would just like to wander
around in untouristed areas - namely to precisely get in touch with those
who are not spoiled by mass-tourism - and they very eagerly explain to you
that you are way off the path to temple so-and-so.


<H2>Day 15: Luxor - Qena - Port Safaga - Hurghada</H2>

Today is souvenir shopping day, because it's our last opportunity for
quality stuff at reasonable prices, and from a decent selection.  It's
quite easy to haggle some dealers down by 75%, showing how stupid some
tourists must be to ever let them try such exorbitant first bids.  At the
same time, Marc shoots a lot of closeup pictures of the street-life in the
souks, asking for permissions of course.

<P>Templed out, we turn our backs to the Nile Valley, and board a bus at
4pm bound for Hurghada, a beach resort on the Red Sea coast, and our
stepping stone to the Sinai peninsula, and new adventures.  But we first
say good-bye to Roseanne and Alan, who will stay in Luxor for a few more
days, and who have been on Sinai before anyway.  So our clan of eight is
reduced to the original four again:  Susan, Steve, Marc, and I.  Yalla
(let's go)!

<P>The ride across the Red Sea Mountains is very boring, and only short
stops in Qena and Port Safaga allow some leg-stretching.  Once in Hurghada,
things become very hectic; actually already on the bus, where hotel touts
are desperate for business, and promise incredible luxury for next-to-zero
prices.  But we stay unirritated, and Steve soon whisks us into a taxi
bound for My Place, for which we carry a referral from the Grand Hotel.
This place is managed by...  a young Japanese, and is incredibly clean for
lowbudget standards.  However, Yoki is unable to squeeze out four more
tickets for tomorrow morning's ferry to Sharm el-Sheikh (Sinai), because it
is already sold-out.  And the day after is a Friday (the Muslim rest day),
so no ferry either.  Oh well, so we have the alternative of sticking it out
in Hurghada, which doesn't come with great credentials, for two days, or
embarking on an 18hr service taxi relay all around the coasts of the Gulf
of Suez.  Too tired for such decisions, we delay this to tomorrow, and go
for a good dinner at Aladin's Lamp.

<H3>Movies</H3>

Egyptians are crazy about movies, too.  And they produce their own films,
which they export to all of the Arabic-speaking world, just like their
music, thus making the Egyptian dialect understood everywhere.  Precious
few movies ever make it to the West, mainly because of the mediocre quality
of these assembly-line mass-productions.  We've watched a few in hotel
lounges, but I regret not having actually gone to a movie theatre in order
to observe the crowds.  Advertised with aggressively painted huge posters,
these movies are kitschy soap-operas, with displays of incredible luxury
and with worn-out classical plots.  They are sometimes musicals, with some
famous singer playing the main part.  It's not uncommon that some actors
are involved in the making of several movies at the same time, thus hopping
from set to set.  Action movies are quite popular, too (such as imitations
of Rambo), though some stuff is actually imported from India.  Amateurish
play and low-budget special effects make the nonunderstanding Westerner
smile at these movies.  Western movies make it to Cairo, though heavily
censored.


<H2>Day 16: Hurghada</H2>

Over breakfast, we decide to stick it out here in Hurghada, and to try
everything the town has to offer.  So this first day is for beach-bums.
The public beaches are pretty uninviting, so we drive out by minibus to the
private beaches around the Sheraton Hotel.  Of course, we first try to
sneak into the superior beach of the latter:  twenty minutes later, we're
kicked out from the north end of their beach, and another half an hour
later, somebody else kicks us out from its south end.  So we pay the cover
charge for the Shellghada Beach, which gives us an equal amount of credit
towards drinks and pizzas.  The whole day goes by in total inactivity.

<H3>Islam</H3>

Most Egyptians are Muslims, and often proud to be so.  Egypt is a secular
state though, and the Sharia (Qur'anic Law) is not directly applied.  You
actually see precious few devotees kneeling down for prayers in the
streets, at the five daily prayer-times announced by the muezzin.  This
Allahu Akbar (God is Great) chant can be very overpowering, depending on
the voice and your immediate surroundings.  It contains all the mystique of
the Orient.  Too bad it's recorded on tapes today:  I've spent nearly 4
months total in Muslim countries, and have never seen a muezzin calling
from a minaret.  Attendance in masdjids (mosques) also is much lower than I
expected, as street-life goes on in total indifference.  Except on Fridays
(the Muslim rest day) and Ramadan (the fasting month), where most
businesses close down, and where green carpets are rolled out in many
public places (such as the Ramses Railway Station in Cairo), transforming
them into temporary mosques.


<H2>Day 17: Hurghada - Giftun Island - Hurghada</H2>

More action today.  At 8am, we're picked up and crammed with other
travelers into a minibus heading for the port.  We embark on a large
motor-boat and set out for Giftun Island.  We throw anchor off its beach,
near some island corals.  Susan explains to Marc and me how to use our
snorkeling gear, and soon we jump into the water.  For us beginners, it
turns out to be surprisingly difficult to learn breathing through the
snorkel, plus keeping the mask watertight.  So this first experience kind
of turns into a flop, especially because of the high waves, which mess up
even more expert swimmers' outings.  Nevertheless, we get a good first
glimpse of the amazing submarine life with fish and flowers of all
imaginable colors and sizes.

<P>After a rice and fish lunch on the boat, a siesta on Giftun Island is
planned.  But Marc and I don't feel like sun-tanning, and we soon remount
our snorkeling gear for perfecting our technique in the shallow coastal
waters.

<P>Then we head back to Hurghada, but throwing in another snorkeling outing
at another island coral.  This time, everything is just about perfect.
Afterwards we happily trade our stories, bent over the Red Sea marine life
charts of Shaky (New Zealand).

<P>Back at the hotel, we wash off the salt, and head out for dinner.  Since
it is my birthday, I offer a round of Stella beer, and I have to blow out a
candle to complete the "party".

<H3>Food</H3>

Egyptian cuisine is excellent in terms of appetizers (already mentioned)
and deserts (especially the gorgeous pastry), but I don't like the main
dishes too much, except kushari.  Indeed, you've got to like chicken, kufta
(grilled ground meat), and kebab (grilled meat) a lot, because there isn't
much other choice, and they are often very greasy.  Staple food like bread
(the Egyptian-Arabic word, eysh, also means "life", and that says it all),
fuul (beans) in all variations, falafel (patties of fuul beans mixed with
spices), or shawarma (the same thing as Turkish doner kebab or Greek
gyros), makes for great snacks.  Restaurants come in many variations,
though most are very basic places, if not mere cookers mounted on bicycles.
Many hotels think they do you a favor by including a dull continental
breakfast in the price.  Most Egyptians are vegetarians, though not by
choice.  It is a pity that a lot of good land is wasted on growing food for
cattle, so that the rich can eat meat, while this same land could feed so
many more (poor) people.  Indeed, Egypt has to import food to cope with its
galloping population increase.


<H2>Day 18: Hurghada - Sharm el Sheikh - Dahab</H2>

The ferry (LE60) is quite small, but not too crowded.  Departure is being
delayed by only one hour, and we meet Ed, a sensational Californian retiree
who loves to travel solo around the Middle East.  Once past Shedwan Island,
the Red Sea becomes pretty rough, and our little boat sways precariously.
Faces turn green, discussions stop, people disappear downstairs, others
crowd around the toilets, as the ship slowly prowls forwards.  Very few
people are unaffected, but we eventually cruise into Sharm el-Sheikh's
harbor.  Again, this is not a place to stay (too expensive this time), so
all travelers split service taxis in groups of seven, heading for Dahab.

<P>The scenery is absolutely spellbinding:  rocks are glowing red in the
sunset, distant mountain ranges fade into various levels of grey and blue,
occasional Bedouin tents with camel or goat herds are scattered across the
plains.  We talk our driver into a photo-stop.  I'm quite happy here, since
I prefer these mountains many times over the boring plains of the Nile
valley.

<P>Finally we arrive in Dahab, or actually the Bedouin village near Dahab.
This is a leftover from old Hippie times, but people here pretend nothing
has ever changed.  The magnificent golden (dahab) sand beach forms a 1.5km
long half-circle, along which campgrounds, bars, restaurants, grocery
stores, and souvenir shops cater to the exclusively young guests.  The
architecture is pretty much as if the Swiss Family Robinson had been living
here, and palm trees actually grow through many huts.  There is music and
food for all tastes.  Drugs were freely available until a recent crackdown,
but even today keeping your ears open suffices to spot the dealers.
Dahab's reefs are well-known for their amazing snorkeling opportunities,
while beach-bums, wannabe-hippies, and Nubian rastas hang around all day
doing nothing.  The local Bedouin are used now to these crazy Westerners,
and they offer jeep and camel rides into the desert.  Egyptian playboys
show up here for the obvious reasons.  The legend holds that some travelers
have never left this place, and indeed quite a few Westerners are running
their own businesses here.

<P>We check into one of these look-alike campgrounds - they are actually
composed of mud-brick huts, with two bunk-beds each - and enjoy a good
pizza at the...  Hard Rock Cafe (where else?).


<H2>Day 19: Dahab - St. Catherine - Mt. Sinai</H2>

In the early morning, Marc and I split a taxi to Dahab town, with Ed.  We
catch the bus to the St.  Catherine village, in the middle of Sinai, while
Ed heads north to Nuweiba, on his way to Jordan.  Our ride is spectacular
again, as we slowly gain elevation.  Long sandy plains stretch out between
the mountain chains.  At 11am, way too early for our plans, we are at our
destination.  Only a handful of travelers get off, all sharing the same
ideas.  So we settle on the terrace of a cafeteria, and slowly get ready
for the ascension.  Two guys just come down from the mountain, and
volunteer us all the relevant information.  A late and filling lunch gives
us the needed energy burst.

<P>So at 5pm, we share a taxi with Jane and Nick, two girls from New
Zealand, to the St.  Catherine Monastery (1,570m).  We drop all our
luggage, except for sleeping bags, water bottles, and cameras, in the
storage room.  There are two ways onto Mt.  Sinai (2,285m):  a long,
switchback camel-path, or a short, steep path with 3,750 steps hewn into
the rocks by a penitent monk.  We take the obvious decision, and steam
away.  There are food and drink stalls every few hundred meters, with
rising prices as you get higher.  It's not too hot any more, and we soon
arrive at Elijah's Hollow, where we shoot some great mountain pictures, as
the lighting is pretty good right now.  This is where the camel-path joins
the stairs, so now comes the fun part.  Some package tourists are on their
way, too.

<P>Once on the summit, where a small chapel precariously hovers over the
precipices, we enjoy great views all over Sinai.  A fraternal spirit reigns
over this holy place - after all, Moses received the Ten Commandments here
- , even between budget travelers and package tourists.  Sunset turns out
pretty dull, because of some low cloud layers on the horizon.  While the
package tourists climb down again, the fifteen travelers who decided to
spend the night here, get to know each other.  It gets significantly
cooler, and we put on our sweaters.  At 8:30pm, it's totally dark, and we
spread our sleeping bags over the various tiny terraces around the chapel.
Some rent extra blankets, just in case.  Unfortunately, one of the Bedouins
operating the food and drink stalls right on the summit, has been totally
spoiled by tourism, and desecrates this holy place by actually shouting at
us for buying our tea from the other guy, and by trying to con us into
paying a fee for sleeping here.  Pathetic.  Huddled in our sleeping bags
between the two Kiwi and two Danish girls, we crack a few jokes, and trade
travel anecdotes in the candle-light, until we fall asleep.

<H3>Important archeological find</H3>

Remember Mel Brooks' irreverent movie on world history?  Well, in a niche
way off the path, I stumbled over a stone-plate with Hebrew inscriptions.
I had them deciphered by an expert later, and they turned out to be those
infamous lost Five Commandments.  Here's what they say:

<ul>
	11: Thou shalt not overcharge travelers.
<br>	12: Thou shalt not ask for baksheesh.
<br>	13: Thou shalt leave travelers alone if they wish so.
<br>	14: Thou shalt not harass female travelers.
<br>	15: Thou shalt not smoke.
</ul>

Too bad these got lost.


<H2>Day 20: Mt. Sinai - St. Catherine - Dahab</H2>

A short night, as by 4am, many loud and obnoxious German and Italian
package tourists start flocking all over the summit, not caring about our
sleep, and literally sitting down on our blankets, not to speak about
inadvertently kicking us while climbing all over us.  Our choice spot on
the east terrace is becoming nightmarish.  And the greedy Bedouin nearby
doesn't stop shouting "coffee, tea, milk" at every newcomer.  We soon
abandon our position, and huddle on some rock.  Eventually, the sun rises,
above the low cloud layers, and an Israeli group engages in some Hebrew
songs.

<P>Then the drama:  Marc turns out to be extremely weakened, plagued by
sensations of cold, fever, headaches, nausea, muscle sores, and
dehydration.  I immediately walk him down, acting as his sherpa.  At
Elijah's Hollow, he opts for the camel-path again, because there is no way
he could concentrate on more steps than the ones so far.  In hellish
slow-motion, we eventually arrive at 8am at the monastery, where I put him
to bed in the storage room, so that he can sweat it all out, and I provide
him with plenty of water.

<P>At 10am, while he sleeps, I head to the monastery proper (337 AD), which
is only open in the mornings.  I meet Susan and Steve there, who come today
just for the monastery, not for the actual climb onto Mt.  Sinai.  We visit
the Greek Orthodox basilica with its spectacular gold decoration, wood
carvings, and icon collection.  "It's beautiful" Steve says to the young
US-monk at the doorway, and this one almost snaps back:  "It's not
beautiful, it's miraculous."  OK, OK.  The monastery also features Moses'
Well (where Moses met his future wife Zipporah), a descendant of the
Burning Bush, and a Charnel House.  The latter is quite spectacular with
its heaps of skulls and bones - the cemetery is too small - , plus the
all-dressed up sitting skeleton of St.  Stephanos, the whole display being
submerged in a suffocating putrefactive stench.

<P>Back to Marc:  we catch the 1pm bus to Dahab, check in at the Hard Rock
Cafe's campground to which Susan and Steve have moved in the meantime, and
eventually decide to locate a physician.  He diagnoses a gastro-enteritis
and hands over tons of medication, all together for an incredibly low LE10.
Health services are actually free for Egyptians.

<H3>Money</H3>

Most people, especially package tourists, have no clue about what money is
worth in other countries.  For instance, the average Egyptian worker earns
LE4 a day.  Small wonder that baksheesh for little services is a welcome
complement to such meager salaries.  But it is frightening to observe the
vicious circle created by mass tourism.  On the one hand, it creates jobs
and attracts much-needed money.  But on the other hand, the whole economy
is messed up, not to mention the mentality of some Egyptians, when
foreigners start literally throwing money around.  This behavior attracts
contempt of the locals, to which the tourists react with scorn, and it
becomes difficult to escape these stereotypes.

<P>Even if souvenirs or other items seem dirt-cheap, that doesn't mean that
you should not bargain over them, as you are likely to be overcharged many
times.  If you don't haggle them down, which is actually almost considered
an insult, you leave the impression that all Westerners are rich and don't
care about money.  This makes life unbearable for the budget traveler who
wants to pay Egyptian prices, not tourist prices.  Ana mish sayyeh (I'm not
a tourist)!  And it turns those who do business with tourists into greedy
money-monsters, screwing up their personalities.

<P>Beggars, cripples, and homeless people usually easily survive on the
sole donations made by Egyptians (zakat is one of the five requirements of
Islam), and rarely seek out tourists.  Those who do often don't need it,
and are crooks, or spend your money on cigarettes anyway.  Some children
have learned that simply asking for baksheesh works well in touristed
areas:  but if a father sees that they make more money than himself, and in
a much easier fashion, he will actually send them out to do so, preventing
them from going to school.  Mafish fulus (there is no money)!  Other kids
ask for pens or candy, but again you'd better refrain from donations, so as
to prevent a dependence Egypt could well do without.  The meaning of
baksheesh has significantly changed with time:  originally, it was a gift
to the guest by the host, then it became a gift to the host by the guest,
nowadays it's mostly a tip for lesser services, and soon it will be mere
alms.


<H2>Day 21: Dahab</H2>

Another lazy day of playing beach-bums and snorkeling, while Marc slowly
recovers from Pharaoh's Revenge.  At the spectacular reef at the north end
of the bay, we spot many new varieties of fish.  Here's what you experience
when you swim out.  When stepping into the lagoon, you're about knee-deep
in very clear and warm water.  The ground is a mixture of stone and sand,
but dangerous because of sea urchins, so you'd better start snorkeling
right away, unless you are even more afraid to scratch your chest.  As you
proceed forwards, you swim through schools of damselfish that are flitting
about, and encounter starfish, sea slugs, clams, anemone fish, clownfish,
butterfly fish, blennies, and so on.  Next comes the reef flat, not much
deeper actually, with cutting corals, anemones, damselfish, angelfish,
parrotfish, snappers, and others.  All in amazing colors.  Finally you get
to the reef crest, a sheer drop-off whose depth you can't fathom, where yet
other varieties of fish await you.  The water is deep-blue, and the
individual sunrays exploring the depths give a surreal feel to the whole
scenery.  Susan even encounters some Napoleon fish, which are larger than
herself, as well as a water-borne LE10 note.  I didn't swim out further,
but a submarine pillar often follows where you can watch more fish without
needing diving gear.  Beyond that, you might encounter sharks...


<H2>Day 22: Dahab - Nuweiba - Aqaba (Jordan)</H2>

In the early morning, seven travelers split a service taxi from Dahab to
Nuweiba.  They are Susan, Steve, Marc, and I, plus Shaky (the Kiwi), Mark
(Canada), and John (UK).  The harbor turns out to be flooded by people:
Egyptians returning to their jobs in the Gulf States, and dozens over
dozens of buses filled with pilgrims.  Yes, the hadj season (annual
pilgrimage to Mekka) has started.  There are huge waiting lines, in the
already blazing sunlight.  But some friendly military policemen take us in
charge, and whisk us through some back-door into the ticket office, where
we have to pay $25 cash each.  But at customs, in a shaded hall, we have to
wait like everybody else, although nobody bothers to check our luggage.
Emigration is pretty straightforward, too.  We are asked to wait in a huge
hall until the ferry is ready.  It's 9am, and departure is scheduled for
10am.  Of course, with this mess, we're not too optimistic about accurate
timings.

<P>Eventually, they tell us to board one of the bus-shuttles covering the
500m to the ferry.  Easier said than done:  after two failures to get even
remotely close to a bus-door, we imitate the locals, elbow-push our ways
through, and board across windows.  It's pathetic:  it's plain obvious that
the ship won't leave until everybody is on it, and yet people insist on
beating the Guiness Book filling record with every shuttle.  Moreover, why
can't we just walk to the ferry?  Oh well.  Once there, we're kindly asked
to drop our backpacks on the parking deck, and to climb to the passenger
decks.  We have to abandon our passports as well.  The A/C Pullman seats
are already taken, so we climb onto the upper deck, and sit down on some
boxes on the west deck, where the shade is.  During the next 3 hours, it
looks like they also want to figure out how many people will fit onto the
ferry.  A lot!  A long column of trucks, loaded with zillions of sheep that
are to be sacrificed in Mekka, enters the ferry.  Meanwhile, the sun has
turned around, and our choice spot selected for a morning passage, turns
into a baking oven.  But nobody cares, nor complains.  Fatalism.
Eventually, only 6 hours late, the ship leaves.

<P>We swiftly cruise north.  There is no wind, and we have to abandon our
positions for a more shaded one next to the captain's bridge, where a small
Italian package tour-group has found refuge as well.  The Gulf of Aqaba is
closing at the horizon, and we enjoy the rare opportunity of seeing four
countries at the same time:  Egypt, Israel, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia, in
clockwise fashion.

<P>End-of-Part-I.  This travelogue continues in
