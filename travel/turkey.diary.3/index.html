For Seker BayramI (Sugar Feast in English, "eid-al-fitr" in Arabic, i.e.
the Islamic holiday at the end of "ramazan" ("ramadan" in Arabic), the
fasting month), I drove with Andrew to the Mediterranean Sea ("akdeniz" in
Turkish:  the White Sea).  Here's an account of what we saw, and of what we
did and thought.

<H2>Saturday 12 March 1994</H2>

<H3>The road</H3>

In Ankara, it is still cold as we leave in the early morning, heading south
towards Konya (the city of Mevlana and the "Whirling Dervishes", also see
my first Diary).  For the "bayramlar", all of Turkey is traveling to see
their relatives or to relax at some resort, so traffic tends to be rather
dense, except that trucks are (normally!)  not allowed to circulate.  But
it isn't too bad on the Konya road, as most people head west to istanbul,
respectively south-west to Antalya, Marmaris, Bodrum, izmir, etc.  So we
just have to pay attention to the comparatively small trickle of cars
heading south-east to Adana, Cappadocia, or "lesser" resorts on the eastern
Mediterranean.  After Konya, we even virtually have the road to ourselves,
as we head south straight across the "Toros DaGlarI" (Taurus Mountains) in
order to check them out for future trips.  These mountains are indeed as
spectacular as every guidebook or friend told us so far, so we decide to be
back there some day for hiking purposes.  The road winds up and down the
slopes, the higher parts being snow-covered, and we advance painstakingly
slowly, but have the time to admire the place.  Eventually, around
lunch-time, we "fly" down the final slope to Manavgat, on the
Mediterranean.

<P>We turn east, towards Alanya, our first objective.  But hunger compels
us to stop earlier.  Unfortunately, as for the rest of this trip, and as
during every "bayram", tracking down an open "lokanta" (restaurant) is a
major feat:  virtually the whole economy grinds to a halt, as everybody is
supposed to be staying/eating with their relatives, rather than wasting
energy on visiting places.  The few open "bakkallar" (groceries) and
"lokantalar" can usually be found in bigger villages, or near
summer-resorts, but the choice will be very restricted.  Eventually, after
numerous halts for asking around, we do find an open "lokanta" (probably
run by some greedy people, but why care when you are hungry?), which
everybody else roaming around seems to have found.  A filling basic meal
later, we drive the remaining stretch to Alanya, where finding a dirt-cheap
pension is a cakewalk at this time of the year.

<H3>Alanya</H3>

So we have the whole afternoon to see this beautiful city, which isn't yet
overrun this season by German package tourists.  Indeed, many of the locals
seem to be complaining about this, so they bask in the sunlight and enjoy
the last few weeks before the big tide of the Deutsch-Mark economy takes
over.  The harbor is very nice, and features one of Turkey's main
postcard-shots (also depicted on the 250,000TL bank-note):  the massive
"KIzIl Kule" (red tower) built in the 13th century by the Seldjuk Turks.
There is a small ethnographic museum inside, and the view from its 33m-high
top is quite beguiling.  A small overgrown path leads from there along the
sea-side ramparts to a superbly well-preserved boat-yard of the same era.
From there, we head straight up the hill towards the citadel that dominates
the city.  There is no real path, it's just across the thickets, sometimes
past old decaying Ottoman wooden houses, and finally we reach an asphalt
road near the top.  Life seems to have stood still here:  it's village life
at a stone-throw from the city-center, and people live simply here and in
defiant mockery of the greedy life down there.  The old mosque is closed,
and the "imam" nowhere in sight, so we continue our crawl up to the main
part of the impressive fortifications.  We'd only have 15' left for the
visit, so we skip it, and wait for the sunset near a wall overhanging the
cliff and Cleopatra's Beach (she's said to have sun-bathed there, while
flirting with Marc Antony, who "gave" her Alanya, so that her workers could
deforest the surrounding hills to rebuild her navy).

<H3>Conning the con-artist</H3>

After a "dolmuS"-ride back to the city-center, it's "baklava ve Cay" time
(time for a snack and tea at a pastry-shop, my favorite pastime in Turkey).
So we enter the nearest "pastane" (also see my second "Diary") and gorge
ourselves on, well, gorgeously sweet pastry (it's the Sugar Feast after
all, so nobody feels guilty).  As tables become scarce, two middle-aged
Turks ask us whether they can share our table.  Sure!  Overhearing our
discussion in English, one of them stirs, and asks us in perfect English
where we are from.  Aaah, so we really are no f*cking (sic) Germans (1st
hint)!  It turns out that Ali was a professional sailor and lived for many
years in Australia.  Hocam (literally "my teacher", his nickname for his
younger cousin) doesn't speak English, and is moonlighting as a
taxi-driver.  Ali is slightly tipsy from beer, but apparently for good
reasons:  his clan extended to 532 members (how precise!, 2nd hint) a few
hours ago, as one of his daughters (among 9 children) delivered her first
baby-boy in istanbul, so he's celebrating his becoming a grand-father (for
the second time).

<P>A few rounds of "Cay" later, it's dinner-time, and Ali invites us to
have dinner at a fish-farm of his clan in the immediate hinterland of
Alanya.  A few "Sure, why not?"  glances between Andrew and me later, Hocam
drives us all (taxi-meter not running) to that place.  Common-sense
dictates us to memorize every twist and turn of the road, so that we find
our way back, just in case.  Ali explains us that he's half-Azeri, half
Kurdish, and that his clan has been moved in the early 1930s from Kurdistan
to Alanya.  He doesn't seem to bear Ataturk or Turkey any grudges, though,
on the contrary, and his clan is obviously prospering.  He asks us where we
work in Turkey, and after our telling him, he exclaims that his youngest
son just finished Prep School at our university with high honors, and even
got a medal from the late President Turgut Ozal.  We should definitely meet
his son, once back.  So we ask for his name and department, but somehow Ali
doesn't want to give these easy details (3rd hint).  Eventually he decides
that his son will enter the Faculty of Engineering:  fat luck, I tell him,
because I teach there, and Ali visibly winces (4th hint) at his bad guess.
As we enter the clan's area, Ali instructs Hocam to stop at every passersby
to wish a nice "bayram", and to show us that he is indeed known by
everybody here (nice show, Ali!).

<P>The fish-farm is totally deserted (the clan is obviously celebrating
their "bayram" somewhere else?!).  But somebody <I>is</I> there, and must now
pose as cook for the next few hours.  After designating the fish we want
from the pool, and after preferring wine over beer (the very best
family-wine, though somehow served from sealed Turasan [the best winery in
Cappadocia] bottles, 5th hint), we are alone with Hocam, while Ali helps
the "cook" in preparing a salad (with only the freshest produce from the
clan's gardens!).  Hocam starts the oven for some heat, and lays the table
for us.  Eventually, they dish up a decent dinner, though only for Andrew
and I.  While we eat, and finish off almost two bottles of white wine, Ali,
Hocam, and the "cook" each nurse several bottles of Efes beer.

<P>Only Ali speaks English, and Hocam looks terribly bored.  Somehow we
wish our Turkish was better, so that Hocam could tell us which way we are
going.  But it's all fun, and perfectly safe and innocent so far, so why
worry?  As the evening advances, and the alcohol level in our vessels
increases, Ali's stories become more and more outrageous.

<P>He grabs a "saz" (a Turkish string instrument) from the wall, and plays
a few inspired songs.  Our clear favorite is the "Kilim Song", his own
composition, which he supposedly sang in Monte Carlo while on a Kurdish
cultural delegation received by French President Francois Mitterrand (yes!,
6th hint).  He translates the lyrics of this ode to the kilim and the
women/girls who weave them.  But the late President Turgut Ozal (himself of
Kurdish origins!)  apparently didn't like the political under-tone of Ali's
song, so Ali had to spend 10 days in jail for it (7th hint).  Come on, good
old boy, your nose is soon going to grow through the window!  But the
buzzword is finally out!

<P>Next come the stories of his sexual heroics [partly censored here!]  in
the harbors all around this world.  His description of Dahab on the
Egyptian Sinai peninsula is very accurate though; that's where he seduced a
Belgian girl (like most Turks, he can't tell Luxembourg and Belgium apart:
referring to your home-country is a classical strategy; 8th hint,
especially as he seems convinced that Belgian French is the most
beautiful-sounding version of all French dialects:  oh well?!), right under
the eyes of her hapless boyfriend.  Many conquests later (including the
promise that when we go to Alanya's bars later tonight, many women, even
married ones, will fall around his neck trying to lure him into their beds,
as he's known to be the best lover in the area!), he admits that the very
best and most beautiful woman in the world is nevertheless his (Kurdish)
wife, and he almost moves us to tears with his heart-rendering account of
her goodness and forgiveness.

<P>Then comes the confession that he's in fact incredibly rich, but that
money ain't important, so he is never showing it (off-the-rack clothing,
unshaven, etc).  But his son (the one at the Prep School of our university)
didn't want it that way, and asked him for a car so that he could show off
on our campus, where all these outrageously rich daughters parade around in
search of wealthy husbands.  So Ali didn't buy his (still unnamed) son only
one car, but three cars, including a Ferrari (9th hint)!  Part of the
wealth comes from a chain of 97 (yeah, this fascination for precise
numbers!)  carpet-stores managed by the now 532 (how the hell did he
remember that figure?)  members of his clan all around Turkey (make that 10
hints).  We still don't bite the bait, though.

<P>Willing to keep our promise of treating him to some beer in town after
he has treated us to dinner, we ask Hocam to drive us back to Alanya.
Hocam is immensely relieved at this opportunity, and speeds away as soon as
he drops us in front of the Manhattan Bar.  Surprisingly, none of the women
at the bar even bothers to look at Ali...  Three rounds of beer later, we
"miraculously" get back to talking about carpets, and this time we
deliberately walk into the trap.  "Yeah, of course we are interested in
some fine <I>old</I> kilims.  [...]  So none of your 97 stores has such ones,
they only run these junky, flashy, machine-woven tourist kilims?  Too bad.
[...]  Aaah, but one of your friends has a few rare old pieces!  We should
definitely have a look at them!".

<P>So off we are, after a phone call to the friend so that he open his
store at this ungodly hour.  Hey, but let's pick up a bottle of "rakI" (the
Turkish answer to the French "pastis" or the Greek "ouzo") at a still-open
grocery on the way (on Andrew's tab).  The store owner looks like a "dinci"
(religious man) and refuses to share the "rakI".  He lets Ali display his
kilims, and sits at his desk, chain-smoking and vaguely hoping for a good
deal.  Ali shows us a lot of crappy kilims, and Andrew doesn't hesitate to
tell him that we want to see <I>real</I> ones.  By then, the "Cember
sakkal" (round-bearded) owner understands that no sale to naive tourists is
in sight, and he turns supremely bored.  Ali is desperate to spot some
finer kilims, but (experienced) Andrew one by one rejects all proposals on
the grounds of knot density, artificial coloring, non-existent colors in
nature, tourist-motives that are not conform to Islam, bad quality wool (if
at all), etc.  Sensing trouble, I don't touch the "rakI" and observe the
standoff between Ali and Andrew.  Ali even takes a lighter to burn some of
the fringes of a kilim to show us that it <I>is</I> wool (it would burn
slowly), and empties a full ashtray onto a kilim to rub the ash into a
kilim to show us that they <I>are</I> natural colors (they would not
disappear), all this to the slight dismay of the wincing store-owner who
knows that no liras are going to change hands tonight.  Eventually, as the
show becomes pathetic, we head out and sincerely apologize to the owner for
the wake-up and mess.  On the sidewalk, we decide the game is over, and
"wealthy" Ali begs us for 300,000TL so that he can ride home in a taxi
(which amount of course would take him much further).  As we decline, he
gives up and walks into the opposite direction as we started walking, not
before saying that it was all fine until we started talking about kilims.
True!  After having found out where we are with respect to our pension, we
stagger back and diagnostic the events:  he's obviously a con-artist, but
probably didn't mean to try and con us into a carpet-sale until very late
in the evening.  He definitely deserves a Guiness-book entry for MPC
(most-patient con-man)!

<H2>Sunday 13 March 1994</H2>

<H3>Aspendos</H3>

Next morning, after a cold shower in the hot-water-during-24hrs bathroom,
we drive west along the coast, past Manavgat again, to Aspendos.  This
ancient site features the best-preserved Roman theater of Asia Minor, and
is in fact virtually intact!  Built by Zenon, it offers 15,000 seats,
features a rare stage-wall, and the acoustics is excellent.  Behind the
theater are the scrawling ruins of the city proper, with a basilica, a
nymphaeum, an odeon, etc, and last, but not least, a superb aqueduct.

<P>We continue our trip west, and have a very late lunch at some
gas-station on our way to Antalya.  Then a quick look (we make it there too
late to actually enter the site) at Perge, another Pamphylian town that was
successively conquered by Alexander the Great, the Romans, the Byzantines,
the Arabs, and finally the Turks.  An impressive stadium is outside the
range of a paid visit, so we have a look at that one in the 15' before they
close down the whole area.

<P>Eventually, we set out for the remaining few kilometers to Antalya,
where we find a dirt-cheap pension in an restored Ottoman house of the
"Kale ici" (inside the old fortress).

<H3>Antalya</H3>

It's dinner time, but we don't settle at any of the tacky tourist
restaurants in the Kale ici or at the harbor.  Instead, we find a friendly
cafeteria-like open-air affair somewhere further into the city.  A pleasant
meal later, we stroll through town, and have some "baklava" in a "pastane",
before entering a bar for some more night-life.  The place is very crowded,
and we are virtually the only foreigners inside.  A local band plays an
interesting mix of Turkish, arabesk, and western music, and everybody is
generally having a good time.

<H2>Monday 14 March 1994</H2>

We have breakfast at a "Cayhane" in the park facing the Antalya bay.  It's
a superbly beautiful bay, guarded by the snow-covered peaks of the Bey
DaGlarI mountains:  here you can ski in the morning and swim in the
afternoon.  Then we do a daylight stroll through the Kale ici, a
UNESCO-protected monument, where virtually all the old Ottoman houses have
been restored and transformed into pensions.

<H3>Termessos</H3>

Eventually, we set out, driving up the mountain behind Antalya, heading
towards Termessos, an ancient Lykian town interestingly constructed on top
of a mountain.  This spared its people a conquest by Alexander the Great,
who didn't even waste his time and men on trying to take this impregnable
city.  But then nature conquered them:  an earthquake destroyed most of
their city, and forced them to leave it.  And that's how we find it:
overgrown by trees and bushes, with ruins lying around "in romantic
disorder", as Andrew's guidebook puts it.  A trail is laid out for the
visitors so that they can visit the most important leftovers:  cisterns,
aqueducts, gymnasium, odeon, and even a theater in this eagle's nest.  But
there is much more to it, and we spend the whole afternoon climbing around
a site that seems to be the Turkish answer to the Inca ruins of Machu
Picchu in Peru.  A distinguishing feature of the Lykians compared to the
Greeks and Romans is their tombs:  huge stone sarcophagi are literally all
over the place, often dispersed down the slopes by the earthquake, and all
broken up by grave-robbers.  The site coordinator must be a pretty humorous
person:  in front of some pile of stones, sign #18 says "One of the many
unidentified buildings" (sic).

<P>Finally, our stomachs tell us that we forgot to have lunch, so we stroll
back to the car and drive down the mountain frantically looking for a
"lokanta".  Eventually, after a much-needed Pepsi at a grocery, and an
amiable chat with the grocer while perched on Pepsi crates, we find an open
"lokanta" near the gas-stations at the main road from Antalya to Burdur.
They have an interesting grill-it-yourself concept there:  you just buy
your salad, drinks, and raw meat (by the weight), and then prepare it
yourself on a grill!

<P>So, a few hundred grams of meat later, we drive back to Antalya, and on
south along the Lykian coast, towards Kemer.

<H3>Camyuva/Kemer</H3>

This night, we need not search for a pension, as we have the keys for a
private summer residence of some wealthy Austrian baron (who knows a German
in istanbul, whose girlfriend teaches at our university, whom we know).  So
we set up quarters there, and have a quick look at the deserted village of
Camyuva.  As nothing seems to be open, we drive the few miles down the road
to Kemer, an artificial resort stomped out for German package-tourists.
But it's only March, so even Kemer is pretty empty.  We find a nice
cafeteria, where some local politician entertains part of his potential
electorate for the upcoming local elections.  Then on to a cozy bar, which
is virtually entirely occupied by a group of high-school kids from izmir.
The solo musician at the keyboards doesn't know how to react to his
audience:  whenever he plays Western music (too often), people sit down and
talk; but whenever he throws in a few Turkish/Arabesk songs (fresh off the
charts), everybody just goes crazy, especially the girls who start dancing
on the tables!  And, boy!, in case you didn't know, Turkish girls sure know
how to dance with their hands and how to sway their hips...


<H2>Tuesday 15 March 1994</H2>

<H3>Olympos</H3>

When I wake up in the morning, it suffices to reach through the window to
grasp an orange from a tree (they have so many oranges here that they are
probably a public good)!  As we leave the house, a suspicious neighbor
shows up and asks us whether we know the baron.  So we recite the standard
story to which we had been carefully coached by Maureen, and indeed it
lightens up his face and we may even fill the car with oranges!

<P>After breakfast at a roadside cafe, we continue driving south along the
Lykian coast.  It's supremely beautiful here, and the lush pine tree
forests make us "high" on the green color (Anatolia is a study in brown
during the winter).  Eventually, we turn left, down a steep side-road, and
then left again onto a dirtroad across a bucolic countryside.  The road
crosses a small river quite a few times, and at one point we help a Turkish
couple pull their car out of the river (you have to cross it swiftly,
because of the soft bed).  Then we reach the back entrance to the Olympos
site, yet another set of ancient ruins (there are 10,000 years of history
under virtually every stone in Turkey).  The archaeology per se is only for
experts, but the site is exceptional:  it stretches along the river to the
Mediterranean, where the superb sandy beach seems miraculously still
untouched by mass tourism.  We take a swim (although the water is not
exactly warm at this time of the year) and crawl through the over- grown
ruins as well as up a hill for a better overview.  This is a very romantic
place, and certainly a good candidate for a return some day:  there are
some nice hiking opportunities here, including a walk to the "chimaera", a
set of perpetual flames.

<H3>The road</H3>

It's Tuesday afternoon, and we both have to teach tomorrow morning, in
distant Ankara, so we'd better get out of here (too bad...).  After yet
another super-late lunch, at a roadside cafe near Antalya, we head up north
through the mountains towards Afyon.  This time we get the full shock of a
"bayram" traffic:  everybody seems to be trying to kill themselves (and
us!), especially the obnoxious drivers from istanbul.  Somehow we manage to
escape a few inescapable close calls with reckless drivers.  After a quick
dinner-stop at a very big gas station (almost a city) near Afyon, we find
that somebody has washed my dusty car!  Thank you, Turkey, for being so
considerate!  Eventually, we do reach Ankara.

<P>This is the end of a great weekend.
