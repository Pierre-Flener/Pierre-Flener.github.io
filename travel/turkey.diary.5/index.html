<H2>Trekking in the Kaçkar DaGlarI (mid-August 1994)<BR>
(or: Ecology and Medicine in Turkey)</H2>

After my aborted
<A HREF="../uzbekistan.trip/">trip in Central Asia</A>,
my friend TuGrul didn't need much convincing power to talk me into joining
him and the METU Mountaineering Club for an eight-day-trek in the Kaçkar
mountains (at the Black Sea, near Georgia).  So we stock up on food, pack
our gear, and hop onto a night bus to Rize (the Turkish capital of tea),
together with 30+ students from METU (Middle-East Technical University).

<P>In the early morning, Nesrin, our  logistics  coordinator,  talks
the  bus  driver  into continuing all the way up to Ayder, one of
the villages at the trail ends.  The scenery is alpine with  lush
pastures, tea plantations, a thick forest (almost a rain forest),
tumbling rivers, waterfalls, summits roaring up to almost 4,000m,
and  villages  of wooden chalets.  This is a little-known area of
Turkey, and foreigners seeing photos of it  tend  to  think  they
were  taken  in  Switzerland, unless they see a mosque somewhere!
We don't set out immediately as we have a  "mission"  to  fulfill
first,  so we check into a very spartan hut and have breakfast in
a nearby "lokanta".

<P>The METU students now wear T-shirts and start distributing stickers and
posting fliers regarding that mission, so as to enroll some locals to help
out.  The mission is called:

<CENTER><BR>"Temiz bir Kaçkar için ilk adIm"<BR>
(A first step towards a  clean  Kaçkar)</CENTER>

<P>Indeed, Ayder is straining under its popularity as a Sunday picnic spot,
and, today being a Sunday, we get a first-hand illustration of what this
means.  Bumper to bumper traffic creeps up and down the narrow roads to and
through Ayder, and eventually gridlocks the entire village.  Cars are
parked absolutely anywhere, and spill out entire families and their picnic
gear onto some nearby grassy patch.  It's all a very Turkish tradition (if
the word "picnic" didn't exist, the Turks would have invented it), right at
the core of their intact family values.  They barbecue and eat what they
brought along, drink streams of tea and "rakI" (a Turkish aniseed alcohol),
smoke themselves into oblivion, listen to music from radios and tapes, and
sometimes even perform the music themselves.  The music in this area is by
the way very different from other music in Turkey, especially due to the
very characteristic tunes of the "kemençe" (lap fiddle) and "tulum"
(bagpipe).  Indeed, there is a colorful quilt of people living here:
Turks, HemSin, Laz, Georgians, ..., both Christian and Muslim.  The same
holds for fashion, well, at least for the way women dress, as Muslim men
are rarely the most colorful dressers:  the local headdress ("poSu") of
women is one of the most beautiful I've seen anywhere in the world.  The
children are entertained, football and volleyball are played, there is
endless gossiping with neighbors, and so on.  Go to any city park or grassy
patch in Turkey on a Sunday afternoon to get a lesson in family values!
Taking a walk is not at all popular in Turkey, because walking (and
cycling) for one's own pleasure is largely frowned upon as a useless waste
of energy.

<P>Now, unfortunately, this nice tradition is endangering Turkey's nature
since recent decades, because of the paper, plastic, aluminum, and glass
that come along with modern picnics.  Average Turks seem to have absolutely
no concern about the cleanliness of nature and even of the immediate
vicinities of their own houses:  trash is left where it occurred, with
often no effort of collecting it or using (mostly inexistent) trash cans.
This is no problem with biodegradable trash, but "modern" trash amounts to
so much more than that.  Only water, wind, and time will "take care" of it,
and I don't tell you what the surroundings of villages sometimes look like.
I have seen "official" picnic spots that looked like dump yards to me, and
if it weren't for people happily picnicking in midst of this waste, I would
have decided they <I>were</I> dump yards!  I have seen people drive their
trash a few hundred meters out of their village and dump it at curb-sides
of tremendous natural beauty.  Now, I know that such abuse of Nature exists
back home as well (idiots doing such things are called "rednecks" or
something similar), and I also do <I>not</I> mean to imply that Turks live
in dirt.  On the contrary:  Turks <I>do</I> have a sense of cleanliness,
and of pride about it, but only <I>within</I> their homes!  Anything
outside their houses is irrelevant, it's the inside that counts (I ignore
whether this is a consequence or a cause of their spiritual values)!  But,
I repeat, in these times of not-so-quickly-degradable trash, it is an
absolute necessity that Turks learn how to take care of Nature, lest their
entire country will soon resemble a dump yard.

<P>Anyway, back to my story:  at 2pm, we start moving through the village
with trash bags.  Only a handful local volunteers actually join us, the
rest of the locals and picnicking visitors just stare at us, in total
disbelief of our stupidity:  it has always been like this, they probably
think, and the trash has always disappeared with time (guess where!), so
what is the point of collecting it now?  As our procession slowly moves up
the village, the enormity of our undertaking becomes clear:  there is no
way we can collect all the accumulated trash that hasn't been "taken care
of" yet by the elements.  Our bags soon strain under their weights, but
airborne plastic bags are somehow always at hand to keep us going.
Eventually, after many cubic meters of trash, most picked up right under
the noses of bewildered picnickers or from the slopes and bushes just
beyond their picnic spots, we stop, in front of some pension.  Its owner is
so enthusiastic about what we just did that he invites us all for dinner
tonight!  And the municipality offers us a free trip to the village "hamam"
(which is fed by natural hot-springs) in the evening!  But somehow we can't
get rid of the feeling that this is a Sisyphus Battle, and that it will
take many more such demonstrations before the right habits pick up!

<P>After idling in the "hamam" for a while, and enjoying the dinner offered
by that pension owner, and a good night's sleep in the cramped quarters of
the rented hut, we set out in the late morning of the day after.  One truck
transports all our backpacks and some of us up the hill to our trail head
at the last "yayla" (see the fourth edition of this diary for a
definition), and another truck loads the rest of us for the two-hour-ride.
We are packed like sheep in there, and amuse the villagers by an
appropriate concert of "bah-bah" grunts.  The scenery is spell-binding,
and, as we creep higher, the daily afternoon mist (we are on the northern,
Black Sea slope) descends on us.  At the YukarI Kavron "yayla", we get off,
collect our backpacks, sip a last hot tea, and set out in a thick fog and
drizzling rain.  A villager leads the way across the pastures and over
little rivulets of water, as we'd probably never have found the uninhabited
pasture further up in the mountains, where we shall spend our first night.
He shows us the wild orchid from the roots of which "salep" is made
("salep" is a very tasty drink made by grinding that root into hot milk and
topping it all with cinnamon; it can be found everywhere in the winter,
just like "boza", which is a mildly fermented millet drink, but served
cold).  By the time we get to the meadow, we are all soaked to the bones,
so it fortunately doesn't matter much to those unlucky two girls who
slipped into the water during the trek.  As the night falls, the relentless
rain continues and the cold creeps into our clothing.  Keeping the
territorial-minded domestic bulls at bay, we pitch our tents, crawl into
our sleeping bags, and cook dinner inside our tents.  Morale is low, but we
all hope for better weather tomorrow.

<P>The sun is out in the early morning, so we stretch out all our wet stuff
on rocks so that it become dry while we have breakfast.  Then we set out,
in small groups of six to eight, each led by one of the most experienced
mountaineers of the club.  We have walkie talkies in order to keep in
touch.  Way off any beaten path, as the objective is to take a huge
shortcut by taking the ~3,100m pass between the Kaçkar and Mezovit summits
(about 3,900m each), we slowly creep up over the stone rubble at the end of
a glacier, then over the glacier itself, and finally up a steep slope to
the pass.  It's all very hard work, with lots of minor falls and
self-induced small avalanches, but eventually we haul ourselves, one by
one, onto the rocky platform at the pass.  As we have lunch, Damla takes
our pulses and blood pressures so as to make a list of the less fit, on
which she shall keep a close eye in the future.  PInar gives the less
experienced of us instructions on how to walk down a glacier, and how to
use our ice-picks in case we start hurtling down the icy slopes.

<P>WARNING:  This true story contains, from now on, some gory details that
are not for the faint-hearted.  You may only continue reading under your
own responsibility!  But there won't be any corpses either.

<P>OK, so down the other, southern slope of the pass now, that is finally
on the sunny side of the Kaçkar range.  The glacier descents are mostly
speedy, as everybody soon gets the hang of it, although some actually have
to use their ice-picks to prevent super-fast body-surfing descents.
Crossing the rocky parts between glaciers is slow and painstaking, and I
remember saying to TuGrul that it was quite a lot of fun on the glaciers,
and that I felt like finally being sure-footed again (after my
reconstructive knee surgery in 1991).

<P>I should have knocked on wood, as, a few minutes later, I slip on a rock
and fall half a meter down and land, legs in jackknife position, with my
knees onto a stone, carrying a 14+kg backpack.  I can't get up by myself,
because of the weight on my back, and when they lift me up, I examine my
knees and say:  "It's OK!  Only a minor cut on my left knee..."  Fractions
of a second later:  "Sh*t!  It's a <I>deep</I> cut...".  Upon closer
inspection, it turns out that I fell onto a razorblade-sharp cutting edge
of that stone, which sliced open my pants, the skin just below my left
kneecap, and partly severed the tendon as well.  No bone damage, though you
can see everything at work through the gaping hole, which makes some casual
spectators among us nearly faint, but luckily little blood loss as there
are no blood vessels in that area.  We clean the wound as well as we can,
but it's obvious to me that I need it stitched, although many of those who
haven't seen it before the bandaging try to encourage me by saying I'd be
back to the group the day after.  Sure, but we are in the middle of
nowhere!  And I need to keep walking, as long as the muscles and tendons
are warm, because nobody could carry me through this rubble and on this
kind of slope.

<P>We work out an evacuation trail, which will fork off to the left just
500m before the end of today's stage.  But until then, it's another hour of
painstaking descent.  Fortunately, the adrenaline rush prevents me from
panicking and from feeling any serious pain.  At every step down, it feels
as if the wound were becoming larger, but skin is fortunately not like
paper.  I would have preferred having to move up this slope with this
injury.  TuGrul then leaves his pack with the others, and carries mine from
there on, as we walk for another three hours down a string of "yaylalar".
They are mostly unoccupied yet, and without any medical facilities or even
road access.  At sunset, we stumble into a "yayla" with dirt-road access,
and the "imam" of the mosque directs us to a pension, after telling us that
the doctor is on vacation but that there is a "dolmuS" at 6am to the
Yusufeli village.  While TuGrul cooks the best dinner I had in ages (or so
it tastes by now), I relax on the bed and feel the leg stiffen, now that
the effort is over.  I must also say that the entire walk of the day was
through incredibly beautiful scenery, which is probably my most lasting
memory of the trip.

<P>I don't close an eye throughout the night, due to the growing pain.  In
the morning, I insist that TuGrul return to the group, as it's all a matter
of hours now until I get medication, and as I'm on the verge of urban
"civilization" now that the "dolmuS" is there, especially that I know
sufficient Turkish to solve the problem alone from now on.  The 60km ride
on the bumpy dirt-road takes about three hours (I could have done it faster
with a mountain bike), and I agonize on every bump.  Again, it's the
stupendous landscape that helps me keep my mind off the pain.

<P>In Yusufeli, there is a medical dispensary, but since it's "only"
nineteen hours since the accident and since stitching is apparently
recommended within one day (I was later told that six hours is a maximum!),
I feel like taking right away the daily "dolmuS" ride (another three hours)
to Erzurum, which is a big city with hospitals.  The people in Yusufeli are
very friendly to this foreigner (even though they don't understand why I
was walking in the mountains in the first place):  they actually carry me
to the other "dolmuS", and feed me with fruit on the ride to Erzurum, which
is again through a truly spectacular countryside.  In Erzurum, the "dolmuS"
driver personally takes me to the hospital of my choice:  "The best," I
croak.  So we wind up in the emergency unit of the AtatUrk University
Hospital (well, I wouldn't like to see the second-best hospital...).  I'm
taken care of immediately, with great humor and lavish rinsing of the wound
before the stitching.  When I finally manage to convey that I'm not a
tourist, but a foreigner working in Turkey, they even let me walk out
without paying.  Luckily, as I wouldn't have paid for what they did:  I'm
not entirely convinced they did the right thing, as I forced myself to look
on throughout the operation, and didn't oversee the slightly yellowish
complexion of my flesh...

<P>The last daily flight to Ankara being gone, I board the next bus
(normally fifteen hours) for Ankara.  Again, I can't sleep, but everybody
is very friendly to me, especially my admirable Kurdish neighbor, with whom
I manage to discuss the entire night in Turkish, without him getting bored
of my struggling for words.  Even the very numerous army posts on the road
(searching for PKK supporters) leave me in peace.  At dusk, the bus stops
at the nearest village, and about a third of the passengers scramble
through the fields to its mosque.  Just before Ankara, the bus gets a flat
tire, but the driver decides to drive on at 20km/h.  Altogether twenty
hours on the road now.  I hail a taxi home, where I sleep and rest for
almost one day, before setting out to the private BayIndIr Hospital to
check whether everything is OK.  They throw their hands up in despair, as
the flesh is very infected and the wound should never have been closed in
that state.  They do another local anesthesia, cut the whole wound open
again, clean it and cut out a least one cubic centimeter of flesh, and keep
me for twenty-seven hours under observation, hooked on IV antibiotics.
When the nurses and physicians hear about my (for Turkish standards:
adventurous) life-style, they issue me a frequent patient card...  (No need
for "geçmiS olsun" wishes:  I have fully recovered a long time ago.)

<P>As a conclusion, Turkey has once again proved to me that it has many
hidden treasures and that its people are <I>genuinely</I> friendly,
especially way off the beaten tourist track.  That recycling and trash
disposal will soon be an acute problem in Turkey was nothing new to me; I
just took the opportunity here to wrap the problem up (using recycled
bits!)  within a larger story.  Most importantly, I learned not to venture
out again into the middle of nowhere without sufficient medical supply and
experts, as the corresponding cut on any other part of my body could have
severed (possibly vital) blood vessels.  I heard about local mountaineering
clubs losing members to absolutely silly injuries, as fast evacuation and
adequate medical expertise are hard to come by outside the biggest cities
in the western half of the country.


<H2>Trips to Cappadocia (throughout 1994)</H2>

The region of Cappadocia (about 200km southeast of Ankara) is one of the
geological wonders of the world.  I haven't seen much of this planet, but
Cappadocia is the most beguiling place I've ever visited (ex-aequo with
Petra, in Jordan).  Cappadocia is unique, Cappadocia cannot be described in
words, you have to go there to see it.  I feel strongly tempted to stop my
story here and send you first to the nearest Turkish tourism office in
order to get some pamphlets on Cappadocia, so that you can imagine the
landscape.  If I had a scanner, I would digitize some of my best pictures
and make them available on the Web, but then you would accuse me of having
drawn science fiction sceneries on the computer.  Knock, knock on my
door...  Oh, it's you!  Let's go to Cappadocia!

<P>Well, let me try then - with the limited (!)  English vocabulary - to
create a sense of understanding of the mystique of Cappadocia.

<P>Eons ago, three volcanos erupted and covered a sandstone area the size
of Luxembourg with lava.  Throughout the millenia, wind and water erosion
would carve out of these lava and sandstone layers the most bewitching rock
formations you can possibly imagine:  multi-colored canyons, mesas,
free-standing rock needles, and, last but not least, the trademark of
Cappadocia, entire "gardens" of the so-called "fairy chimneys" (up-ended
cones of sandstone, with a large slab of brown lava delicately balancing on
its top).  Hence the Turkish name for Cappadocia:  "Peri BacalarI", the
Fairy Cones.  The view of this should be enough to make you travel around
the world to see it.

<P>But let's now have a closer look at these rock formations:  yes!, they
are/were inhabited!  Many of them are hollowed out, featuring doors,
windows, kitchens, living quarters, bedrooms, shelves, storage rooms,
corridors, stairs, chimneys, ventilation shafts, "telephone" tubes,
churches!  The view of all this is guaranteed to cut your breath away, and
you should call your travel agent right now...

<P>During the last few millenia, people have indeed recognized the
fertility of the lava layer and discovered how easy it is to carve the
rocks into whatever shape is suitable.  Entire hills and canyon walls have
thus been transformed into troglodyte cities, and entire fairy chimney
gardens have been transformed into villages of one-family houses.  And
there is more than meets the eye:  over the last few decades, about forty
underground cities (of capacities of up to 20,000 people) have been
re-discovered (the locals having all but forgotten about them) and some of
them cleared of their rubble to make them accessible by visitors.  It was
probably the Hittites who started carving out these houses, but the most
famous inhabitants were definitely some early Christians who used and
extended them as a hide-out from Arab raiders.  The whole area is
unbelievably beautiful, and makes for an excellent open-air museum about
early Christianity, not to mention the fantastic hiking and cycling
opportunities.

<P>Due to its proximity to Ankara, I went to Cappadocia four times last
year.  I consider it my backyard by now.  And I can't wait going there for
the next time.  There is no point relating what I did there specifically,
as understanding it needs seeing it, so I'll just tell a few anecdotes
involving contacts with the locals.

<P>In late June'94, I check into a pension in CavuSin, with my friend Serge
from Belgium, using it as a base for hiking around the area.  The lethal
PKK attack in the Covered Bazaar of istanbul in early April'94 has so far
totally wrecked the tourism season, and the area is almost devoid of
visitors.  Our pension owner (those who know the area will guess whom I'm
talking about!)  had invested in restoring and extending his house, and he
is quite gloomy about his financial prospects.  But he is of course happy
to have some company, and we are invited to the family dinner table.  The
football world-cup is on, and Serge is quite excited about it, as Belgium
plays tonight against the Netherlands, its neighbor and arch-rival.  So we
ask Ahmet which "çayhane" we should go to in order to have the best
atmosphere to watch the game.  And then happens the unexpected and almost
unthinkable:  Ahmet tells us that he is (of course) also interested in
football, and that he is sick and tired of having a too feeble TV antenna
to capture the adequate channels for watching the cup.  He grabs the phone,
and orders from some shop in nearby Avanos a (huge) antenna plus enough
length of cable.  And everything is set by the time the game starts!  Only
in Turkey!!!  (Belgium wins 1-0.)

<P>When I return in mid-September'94 with Guy, another friend from Belgium,
everybody seems to recognize me, due to my previous trips in April and
June, making Guy think I'm kind of a local celebrity.  As we pay our lunch
bill at the excellent "Tafanna Pide Salonu" in Avanos, Guy rips open his
tired shorts right where you wouldn't like to have a hole.  Again, although
Guy initially despairs at his misfortune, as this is the only short he
brought, being in Turkey rather than back home provides us with an instant
solution.  A little boy guides us to a tailor's shop tucked away in some
side street, and the friendly tailor disappears for half an hour as Guy
waits in his underwear.  As we wonder what he is doing with the shorts for
such a long time, he finally reappears, and, with a broad smile, shows us
the half a dozen other repairs he's just done in order to prevent future
damage!  And he only wants the equivalent of 1.25$, which I believe to be a
realistic price, and definitively not a foreigners price!

<P>Another unforgettable encounter occurs when we drive from Derinkuyu to
the Ihlara village, in order to hike through its fantastic canyon.  The
countryside is just sparsely inhabited, so it's only natural to pick up
hitchhikers.  I actually do so systematically throughout Anatolia, and the
following anecdote is representative of the many similar ones I have.  For
Guy it was a "first time", and he remembers it very fondly.  So there is
this farmer waiting for the next "dolmuS" to his village about 25km away,
and who flags us down for a ride.  My pleasure, of course, but I don't tell
Guy what's going to be the course of action.  Indeed, hitching being just a
faster alternative than waiting for the next "dolmuS", every hitcher is
prepared to pay for his ride, because otherwise s/he wouldn't have been out
there on the road in the first place.  I always gently refuse such payment
(and the very fact that it is even being offered to me, a foreigner!, shows
how unspoiled these peasants are, because there are places where some
people would almost ask <I>you</I> for money for having the honor of
offering them a ride), and either I get an incredible number of blessings
from Allah, or some produce from the market (apples, grapes, ...), or I
wind up in a village tea house.  The latter is what happens this time, much
to the delight of Guy and the other male villagers who all congregate
around us and appreciate my minimalistic Turkish.  There were European Cup
games in football the night before, with Turkish victories, so there is
quite a bit to discuss.  And, as usual, the fact that I am a declared
Trabzonspor fan generates quite some aaahs and ooohs, because virtually the
whole country supports one of the three power-houses from istanbul.  That's
why I picked Trabzon:  I wanted to support a team that is not from
istanbul, but that plays very good football and that has some character and
continuity, unlike the spoiled brats playing and coaching in istanbul.  My
other favorites are Bursa Spor and Ankara GenlerbirliGi.

<P>In early November, I return with TuGrul for a weekend mountain bike
tour.  After a first gorgeous day, we wake up the morning after in our
chilly fairy chimney (yes, some pensions rent them out!  and whatever the
season, they are much better than regular rooms, because of their
meter-thick walls:  cool in the summer, not as cold in the winter) and find
all of Cappadocia under a thick blanket of snow.  This way it's very
beautiful as well.  But we prefer to drive the second half of our trip by
car, and set out to MazIkOy, whose underground city had been highly
recommended to us by Serge, as it is not touristed at all.  When entering
the village, we see huge locked doors on rock-cut depots:  due to an ideal
natural temperature, this is where lemon is stored until winter time and
from where it is then transported to all of Turkey.  It's bitter-cold, and
everybody is indoors (the men in the tea houses, the women at home), with
occasionally somebody hushing across the street to the nearest grocery.
After some asking around, the ticket man to the underground city is located
in a tea house, and half a dozen teenagers magically pop up as well,
spontaneously joining us and providing useful explanations.  In fact, this
underground city is unlike most others, in the sense that you enter on the
first floor at the bottom of a hill, and then proceed upstairs, inside the
hill!, in order to exit from the top floor on top of the hill.  In
Derinkuyu and KaymaklI, you descend into the first floor from a plain, and
keep descending until the eighth underground floor, from where you have to
work your way up again.  Also, whereas you could almost navigate by
mountain bike through the latter two cities, here there are no such things
as stairs or ramps:  you literally have to haul yourself through
chimney-like affairs in the ceilings, using foot/hand marks, until you
reach the next floor!  It's all extremely interesting and pretty much
indescribable.  However, to our huge dismay, these kids have the guts to
try to charge us money for the guidance, when we exit the site, and a
ridiculously high amount at that.  So there we are, in the middle of
touristic nowhere, in a completely dead touristic season, with a Turk among
the two visitors, and we both assumed all the way that these kids were your
genuine disinterested Turks, as I have encountered so many in similar
situations before.  I tell TuGrul that there is no way they will get a
single lira, considering that they didn't announce their intentions.  But
he wants to do it a bit more diplomatically, so we wind up in a tea house
and lecture them on how to do "business" with visitors and how to do
marketing.  I don't think they understood such long term reasoning, but to
hell with the idiots who spoiled them by giving them outrageous amounts of
money in the first place!

<P>Until the population exchange between Turkey and Greece in 1923 (due to
their new borders after Turkey's successful war of independence),
Cappadocia was predominantly a Greek and Christian place.  This can be
easily observed by looking at the architecture of older houses, not to
mention the zillions of churches (some of which were converted into
mosques).  The main tourist attractions are in/near villages where these
remnants are not so visible to the casual observer, but once you stray off
the beaten path, it becomes very obvious.  Villages like MustafapaSa and
ibrahimpaSa are essentially unchanged by tourism, although they have some
quite interesting sites and definitely more charm than the tourist magnets.
At a "çayhane" in ibrahimpaSa, a very old man once sidled up to me and
asked me whether I was Greek, or was soon going to Greece, because he'd
like to join me!  It turned out that he grew up near Thessaloniki, and
moved over to Turkey in 1923, but has never been back, although he would
clearly love to go!


<H2>Nemrut DaGI (mid-September 1994)</H2>

Nemrut DaGI is one of the those mountains in the world that one has to be
on before dying, along with Mt.  Sinai in Egypt, Machu Picchu in Peru, Mt.
Olympus in Greece, and some others.  The unforgettable sunrise and sunset
from this highest mountain at the western edge of the Kurdish homeland are
by themselves worth the detour.  But, two thousand years ago, King
Antiochus I of the little kingdom of Commagene increased its mystique a
thousandfold by decreeing that he be buried under a 50m high tumulus
extending the 2150m high summit.  This grandiose site is further
embellished by terraces on the sunrise and sunset sides, featuring colossal
statues of sitting gods from the Macedonian and Persian pantheons.  Due to
earthquakes, the heads of these statues have fallen off their shoulders,
and now stand on the ground, providing one of Turkey's most famous
postcards.  The 2m tall heads watch over the site like guardians, adding an
incredible sense of mystique to the place, and the tomb itself is still
un-found.  The access road from Adyaman features some other nice sites,
including the tombs of Antiochus' wife and father.  But on this my second
trip to Nemrut DaGI (the first being in 1986), with my friend Guy from
Belgium, I again choose to access the summit from Malatya.

<P>After a long drive from Cappadocia, interrupted by an interesting lunch
stop in Kayseri (that's unfair to that nice city:  I'll return one day to
spend more time there), we pull into Malatya.  At the first hotel, we are
told the place is full, and that we will most likely not find any bed at
all in the whole city, as the next day the provincial police entrance exam
will be held here.  After a desperate loop around many hotels, we take up
that first receptionist's offer of returning to his place, as he said he'd
improvise some solution.  And indeed, he sets us up on the rooftop with
plenty of blankets in lieu of mattresses.  Abuzer is in- credibly friendly,
directs us to a popular (hence good) restaurant, and only charges us a
trifle for the stay itself.  Ah Turkey, I'll never forget you!

<P>The day after, we decide not to risk the integrity of my car on the
rocky dirt roads, because the municipality's "package tour" turns out just
$2 total more expensive than the gas and accommodation for two.  There's
six of us travelers on the hired "dolmuS":  a Flemish couple from Belgium,
two Brits, and us.  The driver "orders" me to sit up front, so that he can
chat with me:  he doesn't often have travelers he can sort-of converse
with.  And, sure enough, before even leaving the city, we wind up at his
brother's "çayhane", in order to show off with the "catch of the day".  Ah
Turkey, you'll never get bored!  And then off we are, high up into the
mostly barren hills, through great scenery, picking up the occasional
hitching peasant, and eventually making it to the "gUneS Moteli", just a
ten minute ride from the summit.

<P>And then off to the summit for sunset watching.  In 1986, it was very
cloudy, and thus a major let-down, not to mention the very strong storm
that almost blew us (also six travelers) off the platform during the night
(back then, in the good old times, one could actually sleep there):  I'll
never forget the impassive faces of these stone gods being illuminated by
lightning, while we tried to save our tents in-between!  This time, it's
all picture perfect:  the view west is incredible, the sun and horizon take
all shades of red, and very few people are there.  Just another five
travelers or so, including three sun worshiping German motor-cyclists
(later, our "dolmuS" driver asks me whether all Christians are sun
worshipers!).  Everybody takes the mandatory set of romantic pictures, but
with great discretion and respect for each other, the silence being
complete as we stare in awe at how the waning sunlight illuminates the
faces in always differing tones.

<P>Back at the motel, the "dolmuS" driver and some peasant (picked up in a
village on the road) dish up a hearty dinner for us six (I suspect the
other five had camping gear and just dissipated into the night), and they
even have beer.  We go to bed early, as sunrise is very early.  Just like
in 1986, hordes of <I>real</I> package tourists (coming from Adyaman)
invade the sunrise terrace, clicking like mad, obstructing each other's
photos, talking noisily, etc.  Except that this time the sunrise is really
worth our long detour:  the red disk rises majestically over the barren
hills and is reflected in the waters of the nearby AtatUrk BarajI.  There
isn't as much mystique, though, with this crowd, and we eventually board
our "dolmuS" to return to Malatya.  Nemrut DaGI is well worth a visit, but
make sure you go slightly off season, and definitely for sunset, as the
Adyaman influx is then very small, if not nil.

<P>Malatya being famous for its dried apricots and copper handicraft, we
take an extensive stroll through its very interesting bazaars, before
heading west again, towards KIz Kalesi (near silifke, see my promise in the
fourth edition of this diary), for a relaxed evening at the beach, viewing
the wonderfully romantic Maiden's Castle on an island just a short swim off
the shore.
