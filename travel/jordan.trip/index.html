<H2>Introduction</H2>

This is a report of a trip to Egypt and Jordan, undertaken during
May  1992  by  myself  (from Luxembourg) and my best friend, Marc
(from Belgium).

<P>I have compiled this from my travel notes, often omitting irrelevant
stuff such as where we ate or slept, who was sick with what, how we
organized the getting away from each place, and so on, but adding some
afterthoughts and hindsight.

<P>This journey was totally improvised, reservations - except for flights being a concept totally alien to us.  Of course we did some homework
beforehand, so as to know the must-sees.  Valuable information sources were
The Rough Guide on Egypt (UK, sold as Real Guide in North-America; solid
value), the Lonely Planet Travel Survival Kit for Jordan and Syria
(Australia; a great classic, although the 1987 edition is aging badly; we
met the guy working on the update, so stay tuned), and Le Guide du Routard
Egypte, Jordanie, Israel, et Yemen (France; so-so).  Descriptions are kept
informative enough so that those who have been there should recognize the
places, while those who'd like to go there should be able to locate them.
This report is not intended to be a crash course on Ancient Egyptian or
Middle Eastern history.  <P>By the way, <blink>please do not ask any travel
organisation questions to me</blink>, as it's been too long ago that I was
there.

<P>This journey was a shoestring-budget trip, a mattress to crash on and a
shower being all that is needed when constantly on the move.  Round-trip
flights, visas, inoculations, medicine, and souvenirs excluded, we had a
daily maintenance ratio of about $12 each, covering accommodation, food,
drinks, transportation, and (student) entrance fees.  This has to be
relativized though, as Jordan is significantly more expensive - about 30% than Egypt.

<P>All views expressed here are mine, and you are the judge whether they
are witty insights, total misunderstandings, or unspeakable truths.
Comments are welcome.

<P>Comments are welcome.

<H1>Part II: JORDAN</H1>

Once in Aqaba Port, we are among the first ones to be whisked off the ship.
We retrieve our backpacks, and head for the immigration office, in order to
get our passports.  Marc's and my visa cost only 2JD each, a tremendous
bargain over the 16JD the Jordanian Embassy in Brussels wanted to charge
us.  The visa for US-citizens is free (because of US-aid?  or because Queen
Noor is US-ian?  or both?), the Kiwi and Canadian pay 3JD, while the poor
Brit has to pay 10JD (a revenge for the Sykes-Picot Agreement?).  At
customs, nobody bothers again to look at our luggage.  Exchanging
traveler's cheques is pretty steep in Jordanian banks:  the commission is
3JD per cheque, which amounts to 22% of a $20 cheque.  So you'd better keep
some strong foreign cash handy.

<P>Like in every port of arrival to any country, transportation to the next
town (Aqaba is 10km away) is organized by cut-throats.  The taxi-drivers
want 1JD each, which would normally cover the five-fold distance.  And they
know they have the monopoly, as the last bus is long gone.  We eventually
bargain them down to 0.7JD each, but should rather have hitchhiked.  But
this was already to be our last complaint about Jordan.  The Brit leaves
us, as he wants to catch up with his travel group.  Aqaba turns out to be a
very lively city at night.  Hot gushes of desert air stream through the
city.  The Jordanians, if not indifferent to travelers (this is paradise),
display their legendary friendliness in case you do need assistance
(paradise again).  A man actually temporarily leaves his cup of tea at a
bar to show us the way to the Jerusalem Hotel.  Once set up there, we head
out to the Mohandis Cafeteria for a very filling falafel and shish kebab
dinner.


<H2>Day 23: Aqaba - Wadi Musa - Petra - Wadi Musa</H2>

By now completely accustomed to the Arab way of life, we get up at 5:30am
to catch the first service taxi to Wadi Musa.  As we head north, the road
gains elevation.  Most of the Jordanian and Iraqi (since the Gulf War)
economies depend on Aqaba, so enormous truck columns are to be seen on this
road.  When it eventually splits into the Desert Highway (a boring straight
road to Amman) and into the Kings Highway (an age-old caravan route,
zigzagging through spectacular mountain scenery until Amman), the driver
chooses the latter in order to avoid having to overtake all these trucks.
Past the Wadi Rum plateau (see below), the taxi slowly escalates a tectonic
rift to the next-higher plateau.  Then we turn west, and soon arrive at
Wadi Musa.  I'm very surprised how green Jordan actually is here:  fields
are rife for harvest, bushes and flowers abound, and there is the
occasional wooded patch.

<P>Our hotel is right next door to the rock that Moses once struck with his
stick, whence a source miraculously appeared from it.  Thus the name of the
village:  Wadi (river, valley) Musa (Moses).  Note that Muslims accept the
Bible and the Thora as Holy Scriptures, though with some major
restrictions:  Jesus didn't die on the cross, and the Church is accused of
significant alterations to the Bible and Gospels.  The whole area here is
full of places that are mentioned in the Bible, but I do not delve into
these details.

<P>Our receptionist calls two taxis for the 5km ride to Petra.  We purchase
site tickets, and head into the Siq, a 2km long, at times only 2m wide, but
100m high gorge, which was created by a rock shift.  Package tourists of
course rent horses for this hike, a decision they are to regret until the
end of their lives.  The gorge gets narrower, and higher, and then...
probably the most stunning sight in the world.  Steven Spielberg's Indiana
Jones and the Last Crusade had us all prepared, and tense with
expectations, but reality literally takes your breath away.  At the end of
the Siq, we get the first glimpse of the rock-hewn facade of el Khazneh
(the Treasury).  The morning sun splendidly illuminates this temple, and we
stand frozen in awe at this magnificent sight.  Once we have "recovered",
we enter the temple.  It's not caves behind, but actual rooms with vertical
walls, horizontal ceilings, and right angles all over.  All surfaces are
very smooth, and the naturally alternating rose, red, yellow, amber, brown,
and grey tones of the rock are very pleasing.

<P>Here starts Petra (Greek for stone), the 2,500-year-old capital of the
ancient Nabatean Kingdom.  They were a prosperous, peaceful people of
nomadic ascent, and the first Bedouin democracy.  Never vanquished by the
Romans, they nevertheless joined the Roman Empire towards the end of their
glory days (106 AD).  Then Petra got forgotten, except for a short
occupation by early Christians and crusaders.  Johann Ludwig Burckhardt, a
young Swiss orientalist, "rediscovered" Petra in 1812, but not without
converting to Islam and using considerable ruse in order to delude the
local Bedouins.  The area of Petra covers about 200sqkm, so a few days are
more appropriate than Japanese-style lightning visits.  Not all buildings
are rock-hewn, though the free-standing buildings have all but one crumbled
under their age or the various earthquakes.  El Khazneh has long been
believed to contain a treasure in the urn on top of its 40m high facade,
and that urn is thus pock-marked by rifle shots aiming at breaking it up.
Otherwise, because of its natural protection from wind and water erosion
(it's situated in a basin), Petra's monuments have survived the millennia
very well, transforming the hike through the Siq into a ride on a time
machine.  The architecture is distinctive, was however long believed to be
Roman.  Instead of working against the stone, by cutting it from quarries,
hauling it over long distances, before assembling it into monuments, the
Nabateans worked with the stone, using it where they found it, thus
skipping the transportation and assembly tasks.  The Egyptians used this
technique only sparingly, their grandest example being Abu Simbel.  The
choice location assured the Nabateans of continuous water supplies,
ingeniously distributed by aqueducts.  Their Bedouin descendants live here,
but the Jordanian Government has recently relocated most of them, in order
to protect the most valuable monuments.

<P>We stroll to the Roman Theater, past a series of tombs.  From there, we
climb the ceremonial stairs towards the High Place of Sacrifice, where
spectacular views all over the area reward our effort.  A little used path
past the Lion Fountain, the Triclinium, and the Tomb of the Roman Soldier
takes us to downtown Petra.  We refuel on sandwiches and Pepsi at one of
the numerous Bedouin-operated refreshment stalls.  Next we walk down the
Cardo Maximus, through the Monumental Gateway, towards Qasr el-Bint (Castle
of the Maiden), the only remaining freestanding building here, though it
looks like it will crumble anytime.  The valley is very beautiful with its
numerous flowery bushes that perfume the whole area.

<P>On a temporary sugar-high, we steam upstairs to the Ed-Deir monastery,
so called because early Christians hid there, a longish climb across superb
rock scenery.  This temple is a larger and higher (45m) version of el
Khazneh, and is well worth the effort.  It's depicted on the 5JD bank-note.
A cool and shady cave is on the plain just across it, and that's where we
sit down, for another Pepsi, in order to take in this awesome sight.

<P>A young Bedouin decides to offer us a breathtaking stunt:  he climbs on
a rope to the 36m high frieze, posing for pictures there, thus showing the
imposing size of the temple very clearly.  Then he angles like an ape to
the very top of the 9m high urnstructure.  All judiciously spiced with
intense moments of drama.  Then my heart stops:  he actually jumps off the
urn, landing a few meters below on a sphere,...  and keeps his balance,
il'Hamdulillah (thanks to God)!

<P>Back to downtown Petra, we slowly proceed back to el Khazneh, which is
by now glowing in amazing purple, rose, and red tones.  Petra well deserves
its surname of rose-red city.  Across the Siq, into a taxi, and into a
well-deserved shower.  "Down to one meal per day", as Steve observes, we
feast on chicken, rice, and salad on the pleasantly cool terrace in front
of our hotel.


<H2>Day 24: Wadi Musa - Petra - Wadi Musa</H2>

An emotional start for the day:  after 18 days together, Susan and Steve
finally leave us.  They head back to Cairo via Aqaba, to pick up their
luggage and finish their trip in Greece.  Mark goes with them, and Shaky
leaves for Amman to get a travel permit for the West Bank.

<P>So that's Marc and I alone again.  We hitchhike down to Petra, in order
to linger over details we skipped yesterday, and seek out the odd place
nobody visits.  We start with the three-storied temple facing the Roman
Theater.  At the end of the Cardo Maximus, we climb to the small Nabatean
Museum on the hill behind Qasr elBint.  We circumvent the hill to find the
Crusaders' Castle, but judge it unimpressive.  An adventurous climb
straight down, and we are ready for a Pepsi-stop.  After a cheese sandwich
somewhere else, we have a look at the two remaining great temples:  the Urn
Tomb and the Corinthian Tomb.  Pretty much exhausted, we climb to the
shaded upper levels of the Roman Theater and relax while taking in the
beauty of this valley.

<P>Eventually, we head back to el Khazneh, for another awe-inspired long
stare.  While hiking back through the Siq, we can't help looking back to
this gorgeous temple.  Petra definitely is one of the most spell-binding
places I've visited so far.  In terms of man- influenced landscaping, I can
only think of Cappadokia (Turkey) for a site that gave me similar emotions.

<P>Our receptionist dishes up one of the best dinners in a long time.  We
enjoy a good discussion with a French-Canadian pair-gorgeous accent, as
usual - , while watching yet another melodramatic Egyptian soap-opera on
TV, and then the English-spoken 10pm evening news, our daily reminder of
what's going on in the world.

<H3>The West</H3>

The onslaught of Western "civilization" is resented by Islamic
"fundamentalists" who ask for a return to Islamic values, and the rejection
of Western influence, such as the dynamics of unguided progress.  The aim
is to turn one's back to the West, so as to purify from all corruption, and
thus restore the former power.  Islam only seems a vehicle of dissent, as
the main grudge is against the humiliations of the Crusades, of colonialism
with its betrayals, artificial borders, and established ruling elites, of
the creation of Israel, and of Western double standards and interventionism
into their internal affairs.  Indeed, let's not forget that Muslim
civilization was the most advanced in the world during five centuries in
the Middle Ages, pushing science to limits surpassed by the West only
during the last century, favoring free trade, educating literally
everybody, giving equal opportunities to women.  Read Sigrid Hunke's
apologetic Allah's Sun over the Occident for a comprehensive enumeration of
Muslim achievements that have later been attributed to others.  Is this the
kind of society they want to restore?  Sometimes I doubt this.  Funnily,
many Jordanians happily tell you that they "hate" the USA for its foreign
policy and else, and yet, wearing blue jeans, drinking Pepsi, or driving a
Chevrolet are considered ultimate status symbols.


<H2>Day 25: Wadi Musa - Ma'an - al Quweira - Wadi Rum</H2>

Lured by other travelers arriving with colorful stories, we decide to turn
south again, and get to Wadi Rum.  A rickety bus takes us east to Ma'an,
where Mustapha volunteers to show us the other bus terminal, and insists on
paying us a round of tea on top of that.  The bus- driver drops us at the
crossing 5km south of al Quweira, where the dead-end road to Wadi Rum
starts.

<P>There is a steady trickle of cars into and out of Wadi Rum, so we're
confident to make it there.  And the first car stops.  It's actually a
jeep, and its occupants are Mohammad and Ahmed.  The former is a captain of
the Jordanian Desert Police, and the latter is his driver.  They bought
their daily newspaper in al Quweira, and are on the way back to their
headquarters, 20km into the valley.  They are great fun to be with, and
we're invited for tea together with the whole company.  They tell us that
their main mission is to track down drug smugglers from Saudi Arabia, and
that they are quite successful at it, although it often gets down to
shooting and killing.  Soon a Danish family (the daddy is a UN-employee on
mission at the Golan Heights) on their way to Wadi Rum is waved into the
camp, to join in for the tea.  What a hospitable people, these Jordanians!
If you're not offered tea at least three times a day, there must be
something seriously wrong with your attitude.

<P>Eventually, we get up, exchange addresses with Mohammad, and hitchhike
the remaining 8km to Wadi Rum, across splendid desert scenery.  Monument
Valley (Arizona) is maybe the best approximation I can think of.

<P>Former "playground" of Lieutenant T.  E.  Lawrence's military exploits
with Arab insurgents against the crumbling Ottoman Empire, this place
indeed looks out-of-this- world.  A 2km wide sandy plain over-grown here
and there with the odd bush - green at this time of the year - stretches
between two ranges of up to 1,750m high cliffs, plus a maze of similar
side-valleys.  If it weren't for the occasional Bedouin settlement, a
jeep-ride here would almost feel like driving a vehicle on Mars.  This area
was of course chosen by David Lean to shoot his monumental epic Lawrence of
Arabia, romanticized from Lawrence's autobiographic Seven Pillars of
Wisdom.  Lawrence was and remains a very controversial, and enigmatic,
character, but he has meanwhile been debunked and proven to be a "spinner
of fantastic tales" (says David Fromkin, in A Peace to End All Peace)
aiming at self- aggrandizement, and deliberately deceiving the Arabs about
the true nature of British plans about the carving-up of the Ottoman Empire
(such as the Sykes-Picot Agreement and the Balfour Declaration).

<P>Splitting a jeep with the Danish family for the afternoon, we head out
into the desert.  The driver takes us to Abu Aineh, which is also called
Lawrence's Well, because the latter liked to hang out there, and on to
Khazali, a narrow gorge with old inscriptions on the walls.  A long ride in
total isolation, except for the occasional black Bedouin tent, camel or
goat herd, gets us to Burdah, a spectacular rock-bridge that is about 15m
high.  The remaining stops, at Lawrence's House (nice view), some
sanddunes, and more ancient rock graffiti, are of lesser interest, but the
main thing remains of course the landscape.

<P>The Danes leave for Petra, and Marc and I picnic on the groceries we
brought in from Wadi Musa, or just bought in the local store because the
government-operated Rest House is pretty steep in terms of meals.  In the
starry evening, we relax and discuss the highlights and flops of the
journey, now that we've seen all the major sites.  There are no hotels
here, so we rent a tent behind the Rest House.


<H2>Day 26: Wadi Rum - al Quweira - Ma'an - al Qatraneh - Kerak</H2>

After breakfast, we spend an hour by the road in order to hitch a ride out
of Wadi Rum.  The first five drivers are money-anxious hawks, so we let
them go by.  The next Bedouin is very friendly though, and lets us sit on
the back of his ramshackle pickup truck.  At km 8, we spot our friends from
the Desert Police, and both sides engage in emphatic hand-waving to bid
good-bye.

<P>At the al Quweira crossing, Ayman, a young agricultural engineer on his
way from Aqaba to Ma'an, loads us into his powerful business car.  This is
fortunate, because the road north to Ma'an is very steep, and the trucks
are of course awfully slow on this stretch:  about 30km/h.  Moreover, quite
a few spectacular truckaccidents make us decide not to try hitching one of
these.  The music from the tape sounds like Algerian Rai, and Ayman is
quite happy that I know something about it.  The performer is Cheb Khaled
with his controversial lyrics, and Ayman wants to offer me the tape when he
drops us off in Ma'an.

<P>We flag down a minibus north to al Qatraneh, the crossing for the road
to Kerak.  Two enthusiastic young Palestinians - by now we are pretty much
out of the Bedouin area - offer us a ride west to Kerak, where we check
into the Castle Hotel.  We take a muchneeded shower, and dress in our last
set of clean clothes.

<P>The Crusaders' Castle is pretty impressive, hovering on the hill amidst
Kerak.  Especially the huge underground galleries are worth some poking
around, with a flashlight.  The crusaders must have been happy to have
these cool galleries, to escape the heat when under siege.  Built by
Baudouin I (from Bouillon, Belgium), this fortress is of course a must- see
for Marc, although we don't endorse the misguided fanaticism of the
Crusades:  read Amin Maalouf's excellent The Crusades through Arab Eyes for
the other point of view, and for an analysis of the geo-political and
social consequences.

<P>Then a stroll through this lively small-town, where we try a few fruit
juices.  Back at the hotel, we have a fun conversation with Tariq, the
young receptionist.  George (USA) and Frank (Ireland), the other two
travelers who just arrived, join in as well.  We dine on grilled meat at
the nearby Fida Restaurant.

<H3>The Gulf War</H3>

King Hussein and his people aligned themselves with Saddam Hussein during
the Gulf War.  The trade embargo on Iraq thus took much longer than
expected to take effect, as Iraq had a vital artery from Aqaba to Bagdad.
The growing rift between Gulf Arabs and other Arabs became very apparent to
the West, namely as a rift between rich and poor nations.  The former are
accused by the latter to have repressive governments backed by the Western
powers, not to share their wealth, to discriminate against Palestinians and
other immigrants.  So it is little wonder that Jordan, a small, oil-less
country, with a 30-70% Palestinian population-according to viewpoints -
hailed Saddam Hussein as a restorer of Arab dignity, and this independently
of his later attempts to link the Gulf War to the Israel problem.  Today it
is still possible to buy Saddam Hussein T-shirts in Jordan, and some
restaurants feature his portrait right next to King Hussein's.

<P>On the Desert Highway, the Iraq-bound convoys actually contain quite
some illegal cargo circumventing the embargo, and oiltankers stream from
Bagdad to Amman as baksheesh.  [Note:  Severe checks have recently been
imposed by the CIA.]  Amman's population, mostly Palestinian refugees
anyway, has recently swollen by 400,000 people, refugees from the Gulf War.
This 50% increase doesn't go by without difficulties, and some Jordanians
complain about feeling less secure, and about the disappearance of other
values, or is it a reappearance?  George Bush is of course considered the
ultimate enemy, but US- ians get easily by, as long as they make clear that
they don't approve Bush's interventionism.  Yasser Arafat's popularity is
declining as Palestinians grow discontent about his autocratic leadership
that is not responsive to the changing world scene.


<H2>Day 27: Kerak - Amman</H2>

After breakfast, we take a bus with Frank to Amman.  Too bad though that
the Kings Highway is closed for repair, because we'll miss Wadi al-Mujib (a
famous gorge), and Madaba (well-known for its mosaics) by skirting around
them on the Desert Highway.  Malesh.  On the bus, Frank realizes he has
forgotten his passport in Kerak.  We decide to call the hotel from Amman,
so that George can bring it along when he moves on tonight.

<P>At Wahdat Station in Amman, we catch a service taxi (#27) to downtown
Amman, where we check into the friendly Vinicia Hotel.  Fahmi, the
receptionist, calls Tariq in Kerak because of the passport, and the latter
insists on delivering it himself, as he has business to do in Amman anyway.
This is quite extraordinary, and indeed, 2 hours later, Tariq is there to
deliver the passport to the grateful Frank.

<P>Amman, the Greek Philadelphia, is a fairly modern and clean city, built
upon a series of hills.  Traffic is just as mad as in Cairo.  But there are
not many sights, the main attraction lying in the legendary friendliness of
the easy-going people.  Downtown Amman is a very popular area, and that's
where the traveler wants to spend his time.  There is the el Husseiny
Mosque, the eldest mosque in Jordan, and recently restored.  A few hundred
meters down the road is the impressive Roman Theater (6,000 seats), in
front of which is a shaded park, and a large pedestrian square, which are
great hang-outs all day long.

<P>While overviewing the place from the top ranks of the theater, we are
temporarily joined by Nidal, a Palestinian student.  As the guardian
doesn't seem to tolerate his being with us (after some recent incident,
Jordanians can technically be arrested for being with foreigners), we go
down for a cup of tea in the park.

<P>The hill right in front has some remnants of a Citadel.  We climb onto
it, and enjoy a pleasant view all over Amman.  Ali, the policeman guarding
the site, invites us for tea at his house.  He adds some home-grown na-na
(mint) leaves to the tea, giving it a flavor I like a lot, just like in
Morocco.  He is very happy to have somebody to talk to:  the poor fellow is
alone all day.

<P>From the Citadel, we spot two beautiful mosques that seem worth the
detour.  We first head to the nearest, namely the recently built King
Abdallah Mosque, on Jebel Webdeh.  It features a nice blue roof.  In the
immediate vicinities are two Christian churches, providing a nice reminder
of the religious crossroads Jordan is.  On the way down, we are "abducted"
by Mahmoud, a journalist of the Al Hasad monthly magazine.  At their
headquarters, he offers us tea, and a recent copy of the magazine, while
introducing us for a fun conversation to the rest of the editorial staff.

<P>Eventually, we get going, and walk down Sharia King Hussein, towards
downtown Amman again.  We pass in front of some ministry, where public
writers wait for business under sun-umbrellas.  We ask one of them to let
us have a look at his typewriter, because we've never seen an Arabic
keyboard before.

<P>From the fruit market near the el Husseiny Mosque, we climb up the steep
stairs onto Jebel el-Ashrafiyeh, in search of the other mosque we spotted
from the Citadel.  The Abu Darwish Mosque is indeed very original with its
pleasant alternation of black and white stones, and the view from there is
even better than the one from the Citadel.  It strikes us that many houses
feature miniature Eiffel towers on their roofs:  they are meant to hide the
disgraceful TV antennas.

<P>By now we are pretty exhausted for the day, and slowly head back to the
centre.  We decide to celebrate this last evening at Al Quds, one of the
most famous restaurants in town.  It looks like a pastry shop from the
outside, but at the back is a dining space with classy waiters.  We order
the house's specialty, namely mensef (the Jordanian national dish), plus
their recommended lemon juice.  This dish consists of a bed of rice topped
by a yogurt sauce with cashews and raisin, and finally a piece of mutton
stew.  A butter sauce is served along.  For desert, we treat ourselves to
some of their delicious pastry.  Total cost:  only 3JD each.

<H3>Jordan as a tourist destination</H3>

Considering the lack of oil, and all recent historic events (huge
absorptions  of  refugees  in  1948,  1967, and 1991), the Jordan
economy is in surprisingly good shape. But  the  "punishment"  by
some  Gulf  states  for their supporting Iraq might hurt badly in
the long run. The JD was a very strong currency, until its recent
50%  drop.  Only then has Jordan become an affordable destination
for budget travelers, although the  government's  tourism  bureau
has  totally  forgotten  these  by only building first-class Rest
Houses: well, agreed, they have to start somewhere,  and  package
tourists  bring  more  cash. Politics are relatively stable, too,
although King Hussein has been surviving  coup  attempts  for  40
years  now.  And as I hope to have shown, there is so much to see
there. So it is a mystery to me why so few people ever bother  to
go  there.  To  quote Hugh Finlay (Lonely Planet): "Jordan is the
most under-rated tourist destination in the world". Right!


<H2>Day 28: Amman - Paris - Brussels</H2>

After a breakfast at the well-situated Hilton Bar - a pompous name for this
tea house with a dominating view over downtown Amman - we bid farewell to
Frank.  A service-taxi (#6) takes us to the Abdali bus-station, where we
board a bus to Queen Alia Airport (32km south of Amman).  All procedures
are pretty straightforward, though a hefty exit charge (10JD) is levied by
the airport authorities.  This is the end of a great journey.
