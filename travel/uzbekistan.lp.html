<h2>General</h2>

p.76, Weather:  Mention that the Kyrgyz mountains can be quite rainy in
July, so that (self-supported) trekkers need to be equipped (and mentally
ready) for this.  The same holds for p.346 (When to Go), and p.385 (When to
Go).

<p> p.84, 72-Hour-Rule:  Kazakstan stopped honouring this agreement on 1
April 2000.  This means, for instance, that an actual transit visa is
required for those going to Kyrgyzstan from a flight to Almaty, or those
travelling on motorway M39 between Bishkek (Kyrgyzstan) and Tashkent
(Uzbekistan).  The corresponding passages on p.179 (Transit Visas), p.364
(Air), and p.364 (Bus) are therefore also invalidated.

<p> p.89, Money:  You should not give Uzbek (and Turkmen) prices in US
dollars worked out at the black market rate:  it may be dangerous practice
to do so (the Uzbek police may check whether your hard-cash belongings
tally with your receipts and the bank annotations to your personal copy of
your customs declaration!), and it is currently (since summer 2000) no
longer worth the risk anyway, because the Uzbek government (temporarily)
re-aligned the bank rate (for foreigners) with the black market rate
(though the latter is at the time of writing already 10% ahead), in
addition to abandoning the sum-only policy in favour of forcing foreigners
to buy flight tickets and the like in dollars.  The corresponding passages
on p.159 (Fares), p.274 (Buying Tickets), and p.  320 (Air) are therefore
also invalidated.

<p> p.96, Internet:  Please add my
<a href="http://user.it.uu.se/~pierref/travel/uzbekistan.guide.html">Independent
Travel Guide to Uzbekistan & Kyrgyzstan</a>,
available at
<a href="http://user.it.uu.se/~pierref/travel/uzbekistan.guide.html">http://user.it.uu.se/~pierref/travel/uzbekistan.guide.html</a>.
It has been up since 1995 and has enormously helped (according to emailed
feedback) hundreds of grateful travelers since!

<p> p.161, Buying Tickets:  Everybody we met agreed that buying
long-distance bus-tickets in Tashkent is very easy & safe (now)!  No trace
of OVIR (at least to all of us).  The corresponding passage on p.275 (Bus)
is therefore also invalidated.

<h2>Uzbekistan</h2>

In general, the Uzbek chapter has a way too negative tone (according to us
and everyone we met)!!!  Things are much better (now) than portrayed to be!
Some of us did still have run-ins with the police, but the police mostly
had a "point" in these cases (photography in Tashkent subway stations,
black market usage, ...).  It is of course nice to warn of dangers, but be
sure that they are not freak incidents that may happen to anyone, anywhere,
anytime.  If you just warn of (one?)  rape in a certain park of Bishkek, or
of (one?)  pickpocketing in a certain bus station in Uzbekistan, then the
hidden message could be that your readers may have their guards down about
such basic security items in the other sections of town!  Why don't you
just put all those risks that we even face at home in one nice chapter at
the beginning, and urge your readers to be vigilant, just like at home,
plus a little bit more?  You can then warn of real, unusual dangers where
necessary, without falling into gloom.  With readers reporting mostly
negative news on security items, we want to initiate the converse trend of
positive reporting:  please add 2 to the count of those who met with
<i>no</i> unfairness in Uzbekistan!

<p> p.256, When to Go:  The yearly "saraton" [spelling?]  heat-wave is
worst (in Bukhara) from mid-June to mid-July (not from mid-July to
mid-August).

<p> p.258, Uzbek Embassies:  Maybe add that the Uzbek Embassy in Germany is
(currently) not very welcoming (in the sense that they want to play the
UzbekTourism game), but that the one in the UK is (currently) very
supportive (visa support from Uzbekistan suffices, see below for new
details on online visa support contacts).

<p> p.258, Money:  According to our Uzbek sources, the US dollar never
reached 1300 sum on the black market!  (In early August 2000, it was 740
sum, with the bank rate being 675 sum.)

<h3>Tashkent</h3>

p.259, Dangers & Annoyances:  Officials at Tashkent Int'l Airport are (now)
very professional.

<p> p.263, Map:  #48 (the THY office) has moved to Navoi 11 (one block west
of #30, which is the main post office).  Also fix this on p.274 (Buying
Tickets).  Their phone number is 136 79 89 now.

<p> p.264, Tourist Offices:  The UzbekTourism office in Hotel Tashkent is
(now) very friendly (though not totally competent:  they got the closing
days of the museums wrong).

<p> p.268, Amir Timur Museum:  It is not true that Timur and Karimov
"battle for attention in the murals":  do not exaggerate nor do
condescending reporting.  By the way, entry is about $1 in sum (at the
official foreigners' rate).

<p> p.269, Hotel Bakht:  Apparently doesn't accept foreigners, and cannot
do the OVIR registration anyway.

<p> p.270, Hotel Tashkent:  Doubles are $40 (in $), not $50, including
breakfast.

<p> p.274, Air:  Int'l departures at Tashkent Int'l Airport are not (any
more) from a grimy building.  Also, the flight to/from Bukhara may take as
little as 50 minutes now, if you get onto a modern (RJ) aircraft.  The same
holds for p.320 (Air).

<p> p.275, To/From the Airport:  You can (of course) also take bus 67.

<p> p.276, Metro & Local Transport:  Rides now cost 25 sum, and 50 sum for
express buses.

<h3>Samarkand</h3>

<p> p.293, Post & Communications:  There is a long-distance phone office
near #21 (Univermag) on Tashkentskaya.  It is cheaper than the official
telephone offices, but make sure they know that you know how long your
calls were!

<p> p.294, Registan:  Drop these annoying references on how long the walk
is to everywhere from Hotel Samarkand!  (Did you copy from the Blue
Guide?!)  Same for p.295 (Main Bazar), etc.

<p> p.294ff, Registan, Bibi Khanym, Shahr-i-Zinda, Gur-i-Amir, Ulugh-Bek
Observatory:  These all cost $1 in sum now.

<p> p.296, Ulugh-Bek Observatory:  The little museum is not only about
Uzbek astronomers, but also about other distinguished Islamic scientists
who happened to work in what is now Uzbekistan.

<p> p.299, Bus:  The long-distance bus-station of Samarkand offered no
problem to us.

<p> p.300, Getting Around:  There are almost no local buses anymore in
Samarkand, with "marshrutnoe" (usually Daewoo microbuses) now doing the
bulk of public transportation, along the usual bus lines.

<h3>Bukhara</h3>

p.313, Travel Agencies:
<ul>

<li> Bukhara Visit: add the link
<a href="http://www.alumni.uz/bukharavisit/">http://www.alumni.uz/bukharavisit/</a>;
directed by Mila Akhmedova; offers <i>all</i> services (not just visa support),
and is <i>very</i> efficient; her own B&B very close to Labi-Hauz is under
construction and nearly finished.

<li> Farkhad & Maya's: add the link
<a href="http://www.farkhadmaya.addr.com/">http://www.farkhadmaya.addr.com/</a>);
same p.319 (B&Bs).

<li> Salom Travel: add the link
<a href="http://netjunk.com/users/salom/">http://netjunk.com/users/salom/</a>.

</ul>

p.314, Labi-Hauz:  The old men rather play dominoes, not (so much) chess.

<p> p.316, Kalon Mosque:  It (now) seems legal to also ascend the Kalon
Minaret, when visiting the mosque.  Don't fall for any of the young men
outside the mosque who propose to take you up the minaret:  their fee is of
course higher than the entry to the mosque, and their service adds nothing
to what you can do anyway.

<p> p.317, Chashma Ayub:  The little exhibit on the ancient waterworks is
gone now.

<p> p.318, Homestays:  There is much more competition now in Bukhara, as
you announced, with prices thus indeed falling, so consider the printed
prices <i>upper</i> limits when negotiating, especially that these
fortunate listed B&Bs get many more visitors anyway until the next edition
of your guidebook.  For instance, the "Bukhara Visit" travel agency will
soon open their own B&B (between #48 and #49 on the map p.310):  ask them
by email (see p.313) or monitor their homepage (see link above).

<p> p.319, Labi Hauz B&B (Labi "House" actually, <i>sic</i>):  Their rooms
are anything but plain, but at least on a par with the other B&Bs we
visited.

<p> p.321, Getting Around:  Marshrutnoe #6 goes from the long-distance bus
station down Nizami boulevard, and is thus also convenient for getting
downtown.

<p> p.321, Emir's Palace:  We are not so sure about the adequacy of calling
this "kitsch" and "tastelessness", especially that you give no example
thereof and that we didn't see any such thing!  Also, recent research
(including the interview of a 105-year-old Bukharan who was on the last
emir's harem!)  revealed that the pool was <i>not</i> used by frolicking
harem women; also, the emir would have had to be quite skillful to toss an
apple to the chosen bedmate over that distance!

<h2>Kyrgyzstan</h2>

p.338, At a Glance:  Issyk-kul (lake) is of course not the second-highest
lake in the world, but rather the second-<i>largest altitude</i> lake in
the world.

<p> p.348, Trekking Permits:  It is nowadays not so easy to get one, simply
because it is hard to find someone who can issue one!  All things
considered, it is probably best not to bother and to buy one only if
"caught", using the difficulty of getting one as an excuse.  Considering
the apparent non-maintenance of the trails and bridges, the $8/30 are
probably not going into the right coffers anyway.

<p> p.349, Money:  In July 2000, 1US$ was 47 som.

<p> p.351, Orientation: Actually, in Kyrgyz, "street" = "köchü" (not
"köchüsü"), "avenue" = "prospekt", "boulevard" = "bulvar", etc, because the
"sü", "isi", "y" suffixes just denote the definite article ("the") or a
genitive case ("of").  We understand there is a choice to make all over
this book, and especially in its Language section (p.549ff) and Glossary
(p.562ff), but the more adventurous readers may want to construct their own
sentences and should thus not be misled: "street" = "köchü" and "the street"
= "köchüsü" or "Manas street" = "Manas köchüsü".

<h3>Bishkek</h3>

p.352, Registration:  The bank for those at the "Salima" or "Sary Chelek"
now is #15 on the map p.357, now called "Bank Kyrgyzstan".  You can go
there directly, thus saving the initial trip to OVIR:  buy a 50 som cheque
(for a fee of about 7 som), with the clerks being quite helpful in filling
out the forms for you.  Then head to the nearby OVIR, for the usual rest of
the operation.

<p> p.357, Legend:  Chaykhana #32 is not mentioned in the text, but is
seemingly the only place (with #53) where one can drink a (traditional)
tea, i.e., not get a fancy cup with an expensive tea-bag or not forced to
buy an icecold softdrink.  Similarly for p.361 (Cafes & Chaykhanas).

<p> p.359, Budget Places to Stay:  Some receptionists at the "Salima" are
quite rude and will not settle for anything less than $10 in $, rather than
the $6 in som, if not considerably more.  Considering this and that the
disco music at the nearby Panfilov Park no longer stops at 10:30pm, this
place is no longer the best bargain in town.  "Hotel Semetey" is much
better value, and even lower priced.

<p> p.361, Cafes & Chaykhanas:  "Nayuz Cafe" seems gone.  "Chaykhana
Jalal-Abad" also has plov, samsa, soup, etc.

<p> p.364, Air:  There are now more than 2 flights a week to Tashkent.

<p> p.365, To/From the Airport:  There are also marshrutnoe doing the haul
of bus 153, for twice the fee.

<h3>Karakol</h3>

p.376, Tourist Offices:  The "Helvetas" office is now open.

<p> p.377, Trekking Permits:  As said on p.348, $8 buys <i>up to</i> 3 days
(not 3 days or more), and $30 buys <i>up to</i> 30 days (not 30 days or
more).

<p> p.377, Communications & Travel Agencies:  There is a new agency, called
"Asia Tourism", near #20 on the map p.376, with travel as well as
internet/phone services.

<p> p.379, Hotel Karakol:  The buckets of hot water are actually free of
charge.

<p> p.379, Places to Eat:  It's no longer "nearly impossible to find food
in the evening in Karakol":  there are <i>a lot</i> of convenient
restaurants now.

<p> p.380, Getting There & Away:  We paid no luggage charge on the bus to
Bishkek.

<p> p.382, "Around Karakol" map:  If you want the trail indications to be
helpful, then note that from Jeti-Oghuz Sanatorium until about 1cm below it
on the map, one should be on the <i>right</i> bank of the river; also, on
the way from Teleti Pass to Karakol, the (4WD-worthy!) trail remains on the
<i>left</i> bank of the river for all but the last few kilometers.

<p> p.385, Dangers & Annoyances:  As the trails seem unmaintained, you have
to be prepared to wade across fast-running ice-cold rivers, should you come
to washed-away or crumbling bridges!

<p> p.386, Getting There & Away:  The 10am bus from Karakol to Jeti-Oghuz
seems discontinued; while the 1pm bus only goes to that village, but not to
the same-named sanatorium, to where only the 4pm bus goes.

<h2>Turkmenistan</h2>

<h3>Ashgabat</h3>

p.469, Budget Places to Stay:  I'm happy to see that "my" friendly "fools" at
the psychiatric institute south of Tikinsky bazar are still running the
best deal in town!  I stumbled over this place in 1994 and immediately
recommended it to Lonely Planet...

<h2>Glossary</h2>

p.562, Abbreviations:  Isn't Uyghur a Turkic language?!

<p> Besides, what do you mean by "Turkic languages (T)":  that all words of
Turkic origin are marked with "(T)", or that all words used in
Turkic-speaking areas are marked with "(T)"?  We suspect the latter, but it
isn't made clear.  If the former, then it's wrong, because "aviakassa",
"avtobiket", "bulvar", "kulinarya", "marshrutnoe", "militsia", and probably
"-abad" are not Turkic.

<p> p.563, "eivan":  They are not necessarily study-halls, nor in a
medressa.  It's just a terrace, or an "open-air room".

<h2>Typesetting, Typos</h2>

p.134, Turkish Food:  The "i" in "patlican" and "cacik" should have no dot;
the "u" in "sutlaç" should have an umlaut ("ü").

<p> p.144, Uzbek Airways (HY):  The Turkey office is in "Elmadag" (one
word; "elma" = apple, "dag" = mountain).

<p> p.159, Jigsaw Borders:  The promised transit agreement is nowhere to be
found in the book!?

<p> p.356, Map:  Bank #15 is now called "Bank Kyrgyzstan" and should have a
$ icon rather than just a black-dot icon.

<p> p.562, CE:  There is a missing "o" in "common era".

<p> p.562ff: As explained above,
it is "bulvar" (not "bulvary"), "hammom" (not "hammomi"),
"hiyobon" (not "hiyobon"), "köchü" (not "köchüsü"),
"köshe" (not "köshesi"), "kucha" (not "kuchasi"), etc.

<p> p.565, "samsas":  Make it a singular, "samsa - baked envelope of meat".
