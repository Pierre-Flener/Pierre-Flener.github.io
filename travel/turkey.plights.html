My homepage has some travel diaries and travel guides that I wrote,
especially about Turkey.  As the local web administrator will readily
certify, they are hugely popular and have inadvertently turned me into a
small "web celebrity."  Indeed, I am being perceived by many as a web
oracle, know-it-all, on-line travel agent, or whatever, and receive about
ten "dear Uncle Pierre"-style information requests per week.  Some of them
are outrageously funny, or bold, or impolite, and I want to share my
chuckles with you by hereby releasing the top 10 of what I have received
(while still living in Turkey).  For protection of the innocents, I have
changed their names and email addresses.

Some have their geography all mixed up:

<ul>
	From: The Reverend (reverend@weak.in.geography.usa)<br>
	Subject: New Testament Corinth<br>
	<br>
	During a discussion in our Bible class, a question was asked about
	the status of the churches which the apostle Paul established in
	Corinth.  Could you update us on the status of those churches as
	they exist today?  We would appreciate any insight and data which
	you could send us.  Thank you.
</ul>

Maybe the "cs" in my former email address stood for "Christian  sciences"?!

<P>Others do not seem to know that the "edu" in many addresses stands for
educational institutions, and they somehow believe I am a travel-agent:

<ul>
	From: Sibel Aptal (aptal@ignorance.edu)<br>
	Subject: Ucak Bileti<br>
	<br>
	Merhabalar!
	Sizin adresinizi Internet'ten buldum ve sizden bir ricam var.  Ben
	Aralik ayinda Turkiye'yi (Ankara'yi) ziyaret etmek istiyorum.  Eger
	benim icin ucak biletinin Turk Hava Yollari ile ne kadar oldugunu
	ogrenebilirseniz oradaki THY subelerinden cok sevinirim. Buradan
	telefon etmek korkunc pahalli oldugu icin Turkiye'yi arayamiyorum
	malesef.  Munich'den Ankara'ya ucmak istiyorum (ya da Frankfurt'tan).
	From December to January "Ogrenci" Biletlerinin ne kadar oldugunu
	ogrenebilirseniz cok sevinirim.  Tum zahmetleriniz ve zamaniniz icin
	simdiden cok tesekkurler...
</ul>

(Basically, she asks me to find out the rate of a roundtrip student ticket
on Turkish Airlines from Munich to Ankara.)  The language she used after I
explained to her that I am an academician, and not a travel agent, would
have been ripe for a citation to the disciplinary committee at her
university, had she used it on a teacher over there and written it in
English rather than in Turkish (which is why I did not forward it to her
department's chair).

<P>I was even asked to help find that male US tourist who disappeared in
Turkey in 1995:

<ul>
	From: Worried Friend (help.me@lost.and.found)<br>
	Subject: Intercity bus lines<br>
	<br>
	I am trying to find information including fax numbers for Turkish
	inter-city bus companies.  I visited your web site and noted the
	names of some which were listed there.  Can you assist me with any
	further information about the services / companies which operate
	in Turkey?  I am particularly interested in any service between
	Antalya - Istanbul which would connect through Bilecik - Eskisehir -
	Kutahya.  I am trying to retrace the route which was taken by a
	young US man who has disappeared in Turkey as of September 1995.
	The last news we had was that he intended to travel north from
	Antalya heading for Istanbul.  His primary interest was historic
	sites and would have visited any in these regions.  I would like
	to contact the various bus lines to request their assistance by
	placing missing person posters in Turkish on the buses and at their
	depots.  Your assistance is very much appreciated by the family and
	by myself.
</ul>

I do not know whether he was ever found...

<P>Others need some paternal help:

<ul>
	From: Redneck (redneck@teen.love.uk)<br>
	Subject: Your Diary<br>
	<br>
	My daughter, aged 18, has acquired a Turkish boyfriend when
	holidaying in Turkey recently.  She now wants to return to Turkey -
	to Icmeler - and spend the summer with him, but this would be
	difficult unless she was able to get a job out there.  So my
	question is - would it be possible for her to get a work visa?
	Alternatively, if she merely went back out on a normal 3 month
	tourist visa, and then worked, how serious would it be if she
	was caught.  Any guidance you can give about this - or any
	reference to someone else who might be able to help - would
	be much appreciated. 
</ul>

You bet he has long forgotten about your daughter!

<P>Some ask me to help them find the Holy Grail, or almost:

<ul>
	From: Erich (noah@erich.von.daniken)<br>
	Subject: research in Turkey<br>
	<br>
	I have long wanted to visit Turkey, but haven't made it yet.
	The primary reason that I've wanted to go, was because of the
	mystery of Noah's Ark and Mt. Ararat etc.  I understand that
	it has been somewhat unsafe to go to the eastern provinces, so
	I'm waiting for better times...assuming that will happen.  In
	the meantime, I'm trying to do more research about supposed
	sightings of the Ark.  There is one in particular which needs
	further research.  [...]  I would like to find someone in Turkey
	who would be interested in spending the time to try to trace and
	run down the sources for the English news reports.  That's why
	I'm contacting you, (not that I'm asking you to do so) but
	perhaps you know of someone or know someone who may know someone
	who could and would do the research.  I expect that a student
	at one of the universities may find this interesting and
	challenging.  I'm not certain even if records still exist for
	back in the 1880s.  If they do, they are probably in Istanbul,
	for I believe that that was the seat of government at that time.  
	I'm not at all certain that the English news reports are accurate.
	They may even be faked.  But until some research is done to try
	to trace the source of the reports, no one could know for sure.
</ul>

Anything else with that, Sir?

<P>The world is small, and here is a proof:

<ul>
	From: Nice Guy (doctor@health.medicine.edu)<br>
	Subject: Dunya kucuk<br>
	<br>
	Merhaba Pierre,
	I was searching Internet and saw your diary and read it.  Your
	name made me think I had met you before, and when I began reading
	your being wounded at the Kackar's everything was clear. I am
	Dr. XYZ, orthopedic surgeon from Bayindir Tip Merkezi.   [...]
</ul>

He is the surgeon in Ankara's Bayindir Hospital who saved my infected knee,
after the messy intervention at the Ataturk University Hospital in Erzurum!

<P>Often, I am asked to recommend travel routes, or even more:

<ul>
	From: Dolly (lonely.blonde@adventure.net)<br>
	Subject: your Turkey diary<br>
	<br>
	I've enjoyed reading your over-the-years account of daily life in
	Turkey.  My interest in the country was sparked by an article I
	read on traveling there on a shoestring budget, further fueled
	by attending the Mevlana death-day ceremony recently, and escalated
	to somewhat of a fever pitch by your tales.
	<br>
	This is more a test message to ensure your email address is current
	(taken from 1993) and to see if you have some interest in
	corresponding a bit on this topic.
	<br>
	I am a single American woman, 35, employed in the telecommunications/
	software industry (tech writer) with plans to take a very adventurous
	tour of Turkey in 1996 with two single women friends, both from the
	U.S., a programmer and a business grad student.
</ul>

How  adventurous  is  adventurous  for  single  US  women?  Maybe  going by
"dolmuS"  (collective  taxi)  from  izmir to Efes, all by  themselves?!  Or
going alone to a "birahane" (beer garden) in Diyarbakir?!

<P>Some ask me to do consular work:

<ul>
	From: See (china.girl@visas.for.all.sg)<br>
	Subject: help<br>
	<br>
	I would like to help my friends from china enrol into school in
	your country.  Most of them are gratuated.  they want to apply
	student pass for English course, computer and management.  Can
	you help me to get some information about how to apply student
	pass and visa for China people.  Thank you very much.
</ul>

Where is the embassy?

<P>Others' requests are flattering:

<ul>
	From: Great Cook (hmmm@cook.thief.wife.lover)<br>
	Subject: Eat Smart in Turkey<br>
	<br>
	We are writing a travel guidebook devoted to Turkey's cuisine,
	which will be sent to the printer in about 3 weeks, and would
	like you to review it if you are interested.  [...]
</ul>

Sure, why not?!

<P>And, to round it off, here is an uncensored peace message from Greece:

<ul>
	From: Kostas Papandreos (papandreos@flame.thrower.gr)<br>
	Subject: The jerkness of Turkeys.<br>
	<br>
	Fuck off!!!  Imia is greek.  Constantinoupol is is the capital of
	Greece.  Cyprus is greek.  Go fuck yourshelf.  Turkey is the most
	developed african country.  Population 100% gypsies.  Chiller is a
	rich bitch.
</ul>

This of course went too far.  Here is the answer from his dept chairman:

<ul>
	From: chair@peace.gr<br>
	Subject: Re: Kostas Papandreos<br>
	<br>
	Dear Dr Flener,<br>
	I am sorry that a student of Mechanical Engineering is not abiding
	with the rules of the scientific community and has sent to you a
	totally unacceptable--in every aspect--message, able to disturb
	the peaceful and tolerant climate of the International scientific
	community.  The e/m address of the aforementioned student has
	immediately been removed and [the dean] will take the disciplinary
	measures  which he deems appropriate for this unbelievable story.
	Please stay assured that such kind of attitude will not be tolerated
	by our University.  Please stay assured that such nationalistic
	bubbles have nothing to do with the Greek Scientific community or
	the Greek society as a whole.
</ul>

Getting obnoxious people off the net is thus actually quite easy!

<P>Finally, note that I have made some wonderful contacts through these web
pages.  For instance, every four months or so, there was a message of the
following kind on my answering machine:

<ul>
	Hello.  You do not know us, but we know you!  We have read, and
	enjoyed, your stories and advice on traveling in Turkey, and
	are currently in Ankara, setting base in Kale Otel in Ulus,
	phone 439-8537.  We would like to meet you, and invite you for
	dinner.  If you have time and are interested, please call us.
</ul>

Wow!  I also met an Uzbek, who set me up for a  home-stay  at his  mother's
place in  Tashkent;  an  Iranian  lady, who got me in touch  with the right
people in order to try and (finally)  get an Iranian  travel visa; a Swiss,
who brought me a pair of used cross-country skis and many other things over
numerous trips over my 5 years in Turkey; an Egyptian,  whom I keep meeting
all around the world on various trips; a  Swiss/Iranian  couple that hosted
me in Zurich;  etc.  I have fan email from Dennis M.  Ritchie (of "C" fame)
himself.  Her  Royal  Majesty  Noor,  the  Queen  of  Jordan,  has  read my
Jordanian  trip  report.  The  Egyptian  Minister  of  Tourism  has read my
Egyptian  travel  story.  I  have  about  a  dozen  more   invitations  for
home-stays,  from all around the world!  And there are many other wonderful
people who wrote to me, which  definitely  offsets  the  burden  imposed by
requests such as the ones listed above.

<P>I hope you liked reading this,
