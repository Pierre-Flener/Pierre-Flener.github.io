<h1><center><br>Turkey: An Independent Travel Guide</center></h1>

<p><b>In 2012, I decided to stop maintaining this guide, but it still
contains a lot of correct and useful information.</b></p>

This travel guide to Turkey is intended to show foreign would-be travelers
and residents <i>what Turkey is really like</i>, unbiased by glossy
brochures or homepages by Turkish authorities or individuals, nor by
Greeks/Armenians/Kurds/...  who pour venom on Turkey, etc.  No offense
meant to any of these homepages, but I think they are often of little
practical value to foreign would-be visitors to Turkey.  Consequently, you
should not expect any photos/sounds/smells from Turkey in these pages:  for
fast downloads, this guide is limited to textual information, the rest can
wait until you get there or can be found on other sites.  This travel page
is thus <i>not</i> redundant with (most) other services on Turkey, as it is
<i>only</i> about travel, with special focus on <i>independent</i>
travel!<p>

Note that this travel guide is just a service I provide as a pastime, but
<b><blink>not</blink></b> as my profession (I am an academic in computing
science!).  Please contact an on/offline travel agent, and/or the nearest
Turkish consulate, if you cannot find the desired information starting from
this travel guide.  But I will reply to "interesting" requests (if you
promise to give feedback), especially that I have made some wonderful
friends this way!<p>

<h3>Lonely Planet</h3>

<a href="http://www.lonelyplanet.com/">Lonely Planet Publications</a>
have several city, region, and country guides covering (at least parts of)
Turkey, as well as a Turkish atlas and a Turkish phrasebook.
They are all highly recommended!  Choosing between any of these and the
<a href=#rough>Rough Guides</a>,
I'd take whichever is the most suitable and the most recent.<p>

Lonely Planet Publications also have:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.lonelyplanet.com/worldguide/destinations/europe/turkey/">Destination Turkey</a>,

<li><a href="http://thorntree.lonelyplanet.com/">Thorn Tree</a>,

</ul>

The following book is no longer mentioned by them, but is worth tracking down second-hand:
<ul>
  Marc Dubin and Enver Lucas. <br>
  <i>Trekking in Turkey</i> (1st and only edition). <br>
  Lonely Planet Publications, Victoria (Australia), 1989. <br>
  ISBN 0-86442-037-4.
</ul>

Excellent selection of treks in Turkey, from one-day hikes to lengthy treks
in the mountains to ascensions of volcanos and other high peaks.  Detailed
stone-by-stone descriptions of the trails, because detailed maps of Turkey
are somehow hard to come by.  Interesting cultural background sections, and
practical details on where/what/when to stock up on edibles and equipment.
Needs an update and extension!<p>

</ul>

Don't read this book unless there is a nearby phone or travel agent:  the
Petersons will make your mouth water so much that you'll want to leave for
Turkey right away!  Also, once in Turkey, they will help you go beyond
street food, so as to endulge in one of the world's finest cuisines.  Their
list of Turkish menu items and ingredients is really comprehensive (it
successfully passed scrutiny by some of my female students!), and they
provide historical and regional overviews, a small compilation of useful
phrases for restaurants and markets, and of course some recipes to try
before/after your journey.  Their mind-set is right:  they want to provide
travelers the opportunity to learn the culture through the cuisine, and I
highly recommend this book!<p>

Comments on 6 weeks in Turkey during August and September '94:

Safety:  We had  several  occasions  in late  evening to walk dark,  almost
empty, rural lanes and Istanbul  side street and were never  threatened  at
all.  Local men even carry their  wallets in the back pocket of their pants
without  concern for theft.  Every  traveler  we met agreed with us that we
felt safer in Turkey than in our own home towns.

Water:  No one  drinks  from the tap and good  bottled  water is cheap  and
available everywhere.

This  should be safer  than the East.  I can't say "safe,  period"  because
there  have been  attacks  in the West as well  (though  none  targeted  at
tourists since 1995!).

I see.  But, as I wrote,  SDTAs are rather  paranoid in general.  Moreover,
they always fail to acknowledge  that the USA itself is probably one of the
most  unsafe  countries  in the  world to be (or  travel)!!!  See  Florida,
Texas, and so on.  See the crime rates in all the big cities, and  recently
even  in  small  towns.  But I can  tell  you  that I don't  know a  single
expatriate here in Turkey (and I live in Central Anatolia, not in the West)
who left the  country  out of fear of the  PKK, or is  paranoid  about  PKK
threats:  we just  decided not to go "too much" east,  period.  Overall, we
all fully  agree  that, *even  with* the PKK threat, we are much safer here
than we'd be in many other  parts of this  world,  including  (especially?)
our own Western countries.

Turkey is  wonderful,  as you said, so enjoy it!  So why avoid  places  you
like, but that have  (extremely)  low risks?  You don't stop  driving  your
car, or flying  cross-country,  or whatever, just because there are certain
risks, eh?  Well, I think you  *don't*  increase  these  everyday  risks by
coming to western or central Turkey!  You might even reduce them...

There's nothing dangerous but some operations against PKK terrorists on the
south-east  part of Turkey.  You may safely go and have a nice  holiday  on
the west and south coasts of Turkey,  which are some of the most  beautiful
places in the world,  especially  Marmaris,  Bodrum, Alanya,  Antalya, Kas,
Cesme,  Kusadasi,  etc.  The  weather  conditions  during the first half of
September  on the  mentioned  places  are  perfect.  You may do all kind of
sea-sports.

[Editor's note: This  is  your  typical  thread  about  safety  in  Turkey:

Turkey is a wonderful  country with friendly,  helpful  people.  It is true
that it is difficult to be "left alone", but this is largely because people
approach  you  constantly  to meet  you, and buy you tea.  It's  one of the
places in the world that I have felt the safest travelling.

However,  things are a bit  different  for women.  In the major  cities (at
least in Istanbul)  there is a certain  amount of  liberalism  in dress and
customs.  Outside  the  big  cities,   however,  women  should  maintain  a
conservative  mode of dress:  such as a long skirt, a blouse with  sleeves,
and,  preferably,  a head scarf.  For a woman alone, even speaking to a man
(other than a shopkeeper) not related to her can be considered flirtatious.
If you're  together  most of the time and  respect  the local ways of doing
things, you should get along fine.

<h3>Opinions on the Book/Movie "Midnight Express"</h3>

Oliver Stone, who created that film, is a shameless sleaze monger.  To the
extent that the story is true, that dumb American drug smuggler was
unlucky.  You "hellas", are contemptible for trying to recycle the horrific
images of the film, 20 years on, in your perpetual campaign to vilify
Turkey.  For the most part, Turkey is a civilized country, and foreigners
are treated with respect -- provided they don't get involved in military
politics or drug-trafficking.  The Turkish state is not a socialist
democratic institution, any Turk will tell you.  But the task of ruling
Turkey is extraordinarily difficult.

[...]

To be fair, Greeks certainly do have good historical reason to loathe
Turkey.  But Turkish society has changed so much in the past 20 years,
that young Greeks should look to the future.

I love Greece, but I dislike attitudes stereotypical of a Greece from
a time that has passed.  Greece will never reconquer Anatolia.  I'm
confident that most Greeks reading Usenet are more reasonable and
realistic than the minority who post these inflammatory ...  ah ....
flames.

[Pierre Flener's note: Well-said, Nate!  I would add that William
(Billy) Hayes, the "dumb American drug smuggler", himself denies many
scenes of the film.  For instance, he was in a low security prison,
and he did not kill a guard to get out: read his book for many other
important differences with the movie, especially on the tone!

The movie was directed by Alan Parker, with the screenplay by Oliver
Stone (who won an Oscar for it, with another Oscar going to Giorgio
Moroder for the music score), and is a US production from 1978.  The
story starts in the early 1970s, in Istanbul, after Turkey announced that
drug smugglers would be subject to severe prison sentences.  But
Billy Hayes foolishly thought he could dupe the Turkish security
system...

"Midnight express" may well be prison slang for "escape", but in this
case it also means something else, if one cares to research it.  In
fact, the book and movie title refer to a midnight train service from
Istanbul to Edirne (on the Bulgarian border), which line for a short
segment ran through Greek territory, between 1923 (when the Republic
of Turkey was proclaimed from the ashes of the Ottoman Empire) and the
late 1970s (when a bypass line was built).  During that time, Greek
border police would board and guard the train while it was on Greek
territory.  Now, during the 1960s and 1970s, foreigners sentenced for
drug-related offences in Turkey would be quietly released by the
Turkish Government during their appeals, using this train: they would
board in Istanbul with all their possessions, save their passports,
and be bidden to jump off on the Greek segment, with the connivance of
the Greek guards!  They would be jailed in Greece until they had a new
passport via their consulates.  This diplomatic trick allowed the
Turkish Government to meet US demands and yet avoid inernational
outrage when smugglers were actually severely punished.  Billy Hayes
himself has always been correct about this issue, except in the book
that he co-wrote, and that Alan Parker would pick up this story and
twist it to fuel anti-Turkish sentiments on a very wide scale is
heinous.  The damage that this movie and book have inflicted by itself
on Turkey's reputation is incalculable.  When twisting a true story,
why not set it into an imaginary country?  Since when are drug
smugglers heroes?!  Since when are governments catching and convicting
drug sumgglers villains?  Since when are governments diplomatically
releasing prisoners villains?]

There are ferries from/to the Greek islands that are closest to Turkey:

	Rhodos <--> Marmaris
	Chios  <--> CeSme
	Lesbos <--> AyvalIk

cheaper.  Overnight   round-trips  from  Greece  thus  are  expensive,  and
furthermore  invalidate any return-ticket of any charter-flight  you had to
Greece (the Turkish  entry/exit stamps are highly visible in your passport,
and Greek  authorities  don't want to see these because you are supposed to
spend your money in Greece).  If you are on a one-way trip  between  Greece
and  Turkey,  it's thus  advisable  to hop from  Turkey to the first  Greek
island, rather than the other way round!  These ferries  usually can take a
few cars (but I'm afraid that will be very expensive).

There  also is a  weekly  ferry  from  Santorini  to  Marmaris  via  Crete,
Karpathos, and Rhodos.

There  are *no*  other  ferries  to  Greece,  not even to  Athens.  Getting
to/from  Athens by ferry is a 2-step  operation:  first hop to the  nearest
Greek  island,  and then  get the next  ferry  from  there  to  Athens  (or
vice-versa).

Weekly  ferries  go from  Venice/Ancona  (Italy)  to  Izmir/Cesme/Marmaris/
Antalya:  ask your travel agent, and mention Turkish Maritime Lines.  These
are big ferries  (mostly used by  car/caravan/truck-drivers),  and take 2.5
days (3 nights).  No passages in the off-season.

(I think) there are ferries from  KuSadasI to Italy, on Italian  companies,
but they don't stop in Greece either.

These are looong trips, but not too expensive.

Virtually  every Greek  island has regular  and  frequent  services  (often
overnight)  to Athens,  and  definitely  all those ones  along the  Turkish
coast.  So this is absolutely no problem.

>We are trying to get from Istanbul to Athens, preferably by bus&/boat

By  train:  almost  24h  from  istanbul  to  Thessaloniki  (I know  this is
absurdly long, although border  formalities  "only" take ~2h; legend has it
that  people  took a stroll off the train and  easily  jumped  back onto it
again ;-), and then almost  another day by train to Athens.  So this option
is only for die-hard train-fans,  especially that the train is likely to be
more than full in high-  season.  Buy 2 tickets,  rather  than only 1:  the
first up to the  Greek  border,  the  second  from  there to  Athens.  Much
cheaper.

By bus, along the train route:  not much faster.  Same ticketing  technique
recommended for savings.

By  direct  boat:  impossible.  (There  are  Turkey  <-->  Italy   ferries,
crossing the Channel of Corinth, but not docking anywhere in Greece.)

By air:  not so  expensive  after all.  Look for bucket shops in  istanbul,
near the Blue Mosque on Divan  Yolu.  The only means to make it in one day.

But why do this trip in one day?  There are many interesting  things to see
along the way!  Turkey's  most perfect  mosque, the  Selimiye  Camii, is in
Edirne.  Mt.  Olympus, the throne of Jupiter,  awaits your ascent  south of
Thessaloniki.  A  little  in-land,  the  world-famous  and  unique  Meteora
monasteries beg a visit.  And endlessly so on.  Take your time!

I have not been to Eastern  Turkey for a long  time.  But I know  renting a
car one way is  either  not  possible  or  prohibitively  expensive.  Also,
Eastern  Turkey  is  very   mountainous  and  the  roads  can  be  somewhat
challenging  for  someone  who is not used to driving in that  region.  The
rest of Turkey is very pleasurable to drive.

Your  best bet would be to rent the car from,  and  return  it to  Antalya.
Keep in mind that  gasoline  is  expensive  in  Turkey as it is in  Western
Europe.  So driving a car over long distances can be an expensive choice.

[Editor's note: Gas prices are cheaper than in *any* European country, but,
		at about  $0.60/liter, stand of course no comparison to oil
		producing countries.]

Alternatively,  you may want to try  taking  buses (The bus  system is very
good, a lot  better  than it is in the US.  The buses are very new and they
go  everywhere on frequent  schedules.  Also don't take that Greek  rubbish
seriously about buses being stopped by soldiers every 50 km.  Very recently
I took some  Europeans and Americans  with me to Turkey.  We traveled  many
thousand miles.  Nobody ever stopped our bus or asked for an id.  Actually,
many people told me how secure they had felt in  Turkey--even  more so than
in  the  US).  The  rest  of  the  time  you  can  take   taxis.  They  are
inexpensive,  but be sure  to  negotiate  before  you  accept  a ride  with
unmetered taxis.

The Turkish people are very friendly,  especially in rural areas.  Treating
guests well is something  like a matter of honor.  People may invite you to
their   houses  to  dine   and/or  to  stay.  Turks  take  pride  in  their
hospitality.

It may be helpful to speak a few Turkish words.  Also  Europeans  indicated

due to 2 million Turkish workers living in Germany.

If it is a city-map  you are looking  for:  don't buy one, as they give you
convenient ones for free at the tourist information stand between Aya Sofia
and the Blue Mosque.

A hint that will save you a lot of money:  go to "GenCtur" (a travel agency
on  Yerebatan  caddesi)  and  buy  a  YIEE-card  (Youth  Int'l  Educational
Exchange)  for ~$3.  They might not check if you really are a student,  but
there might be a restriction to people younger than 26.  This card gets you
free  entrance to all the State  museums, e.g.  Aya Sofia,  TopkapI  Palace
(except the Harem), the Yerebatan Cistern, etc.

My  favorites  in  istanbul   are:  the  three  big  mosques   (Aya  Sofia,
Sultanahmet   a.k.a.  the  Blue  Mosque,  the  Suleymaniye),   the  TopkapI
palace/museum,  the Islamic museum on the Hippodrome,  the Grand Bazaar and
Egyptian Bazaar (don't buy anything inside though:  huge savings if you buy
the  same  stuff  just   outside),   the  Galata   tower,  the   DolmabahCe
palace/museum,  a Bosphorus  crossing to the Asian side (nice  sunsets over
the big  mosques:  ideal for  dinner!), a Bosphorus  cruise up to the Black
Sea, a Marmara Sea trip to the Princes' Islands, the Yerebatan Cistern (see
"James  Bond:  From Russia with Love"  afterwards).  You can easily do most
of this in 3 days.  "Advanced"  visitors  will travel along the Golden Horn
to the "Pierre Loti" Cafe and the wonderful Eyup mosque nearby (it's a holy
shrine),  they will visit the superb  Sokullu  mosque next to the KUCUk Aya
Sofya near KumkapI  (it's small, but perfect in its  proportions,  and thus
much easier to  comprehend  than the big ones).  "Real" (tm)  Turkey can be
seen when  leaving  the  Egyptian  Bazaar at the far end  (compared  to the
Bosphorus)  and taking the street  parallel to the Golden Horn (but not the
one along the Golden  Horn):  you'll walk past  (decaying)  Ottoman  wooden
houses and  experience a very lively  market  street with  typical  Ottoman
compartmentation  into  specializations:  fruits, veggies,  hammers, safes,
shoes, shovels, clothes, nails, and endlessly so on, until the first bridge
or so.  Or go on a Sunday  afternoon  to  YIldIz  ParkI to get a lesson  on
family life (the park between  TopkapI and the RW station also does it).  I
personally  don't like so much the  tourist-traps  or show-cases,  like the
Ottoman house street (mostly  pensions)  along the TopkapI walls, or Taksim
Square and the pedestrian  istiklal  caddesi  leading to it, or the KumkapI

Cappadocia is fascinating  with its fairy chimney rock  formations,  houses

It was many years ago that I was in Pamukkale  (1977) but I still  remember
it as one of the most fantastic  sights I've ever seen (the calcium  cliffs
just hanging there above a vast plain and very nice warm water to wade in).
[...]  There is very little to do in  Pamukkale,  not really a town at all.
Besides  the water and  cliffs,  there are old ruins of  Hierapolis  at the
site.  The water was considered  curative in classical  times and there are
many  tombs in the  area.  I'd say it is worth  the  trip.  At least  for a
night's stay; more fun pursuits can be found in other towns.

[Editor's Note: BEWARE!!!  The site is destroyed  in the  meantime,  in the
		sense that the greedy  hotels on top of the falls  feed the
		water 6 days out of 7 into  their  pools, so that you would
		be lucky to see any  water on the falls at all.  There  are
		cigarette  butts and other trash  floating  around,  not to
		mention that the calcium  cliffs aren't  exactly  white any
		more,  especially  because  the  road to the  hotels  leads
		virtually through the falls.  In 1986 already (!), I didn't
		heed triple  advice not to go there, and then I  absolutely
		hated the place.  Ever since, I discourage  whoever asks me
		about it, but most  people  don't  believe me and go out of
		their ways to get there  anyway, but later  confirm  that I
		was  absolutely  right!  Unless  you want to  learn  how to
		totally wreck a natural  wonder,  going there is a complete
		waste of time:  boycott the place!]

Egirdir:  Major  highlights  of our trip  were  this  cool,  mountain  lake
village (2 1/2 hours north of Antalya)  [...].  Here we enjoyed  the beach,
lake swimming, row boating,  delicious  home cooked dinners with our fellow
guests, a colorful  Sunday market in a nearby  smaller  village, and a fine
all day taxi-tour  during which we hiked  through shady Andir Canyon taking
time to swim in cool waters at the base of beautiful waterfalls.  [...]

Southwestern  coastal  towns are lovely  with their  archaeological  ruins,
beaches, and waters.  All-day boat rides and mini-bus tours often  included
lunch and cost about $12 per person.  Highlights  included:  the Seluk area
for  sightseeing,  the ruins of Ephesus,  Priene, and lovely  Pamuak  Beach
lined  with 1 and 2  bedroom  housekeeping  bungalows  for $30  and $40 per
night; and  Dalyan,  with views of Lykian  rock tombs  [...], and the [...]
boat trip to the Caunus ruins, Turtle Beach,  thermal mud baths, and a swim
in clear Lake  Kyceriz.  Pretty Kas had our favorite  all-day  swimming and
ruins-viewing boat ride, as well as pleasant,  unpressured  browsing in its
handicraft shops.

In regards to Troy,  while it is amazing to be at the site where  Troy once
was, there really isn't a lot to see, and I think you would be disappointed
after such a lengthy  drive.  The drive down the  Aegean  coast  however is
quite beautiful,  especially as you get to the southwestern part of Turkey.

>We like the colors of the sea and nice, clean sandy beaches, calm coves.
>We were told that the izmir-bodrum-marmaris region can offer this

1.  Kusadasi:  Major touristic city and  entertainment and shopping center.
Nice and clean beaches on National Park 20km far to Kusadasi.  You can find
many beaches in and near Kusadasi but in the National  Park, forest and sea
hug each other.

DO NOT forget to visit  Virgin Mary House (very  important  especially  for
Christians)  and Ephesus  (major  harbor  city of Ionia),  Sirince  Village
(typical village) near Kusadasi (10km).

2.  DIDYMA  (Golden  Sand):  Very  famous  place with its  beautiful  sandy
beach.  From  Kusadasi  to Didyma you can visit on the way some  historical
places such as Priene, Miletos, Apollo temple.

3.  GOKOVA:  Natural and clean beaches with wonderful sight seeing.

4.  MARMARIS:  Major  touristic  city with many  entertainment  centers and
shopping centers.  Around there you can find many beaches.

5.  BODRUM:  Major  historical  touristic city like Marmaris but there is a
castle  which is an  underwater  museum  now.  I know that this is the best
underwater  museum in the world because  there are many unique  things from
very old times that were discovered by American and Turkish researchers.

This is only a summary.  You can find there many beautiful places.

I would  recommend  Uludag  or  Kartalkaya  in  Turkey.  And you  can  find
everything there.

[Editor's note:  UludaG is totally overrated, and a snobbish place.]

> - Are the slopes reasonably challenging?  Is snow reliable?

Yes both of them.  Especially Uludag.

>While [in Istanbul], I became addicted to the local drink involving

>water)?

It's  called  ayran.  It's a  mixture  of  yogurt,  salt and  water  served
chilled.  The best  yogurts for this are full-fat  live ones; here I prefer
the "Pakav" or "Pakeeza" brands you get in Indian/Pakistani  shops, but the
Greek ones work OK too though they're more  expensive.  Don't bother if all
you can get is some reduced-fat,  killed,  added-emulsifier  or even (urgh)
sweetened kind.

A good book on Turkish food is Nevin Halici's "Turkish Cooking", though for
anyone who's been there the pictures  make it difficult not to  impulse-buy
the next time you go past a travel agents.

Other cold  drinks  you  shouldn't  miss in  Turkey:  vishne  (sour  cherry
cordial), shira (lightly  fermented grape juice, a summer  specialty), boza
("lightly fermented sweetened wheat porridge", I suppose you'd call it - it
tastes a lot better than that description suggests; it's a winter specialty
made by the same people who do shira).

I tried  (cultured)  buttermilk  with  water and salt, and  found it a good
substitute if no sour yoghurt is available.

Date: April 1994

We just  returned  from a  delightful  and  interesting  holiday in Turkey,
ranging by air and bus between  Kayseri and  Istanbul.  We were  impressed,
above  all, by the  warmth  and  friendliness  of the  people  we met,  and
secondly, by the excellent food, especially in Konya.

Several  things  we  especially   liked,  which  would  be  Turkey's  major
contributions  to the world (or at least to North America if North  America
would only accept them):

Ayran (the yogurt  drink),  which we now make at home.  Something  like the
lassi of India.

The dolmuS  (shared  taxi) -- given the large number of localities  in N.A.
without any public transport, this would seem an ideal solution.

Those  "bottom-washers"  on modern Turkish toilets; a great contribution to
personal  hygiene,  simpler and more convenient than the European bidet.  I
am considering  installing one at home, but will have to do something about
our very cold water!

[Editor's note: Beware!  Westerners  don't have the same immunity levels as
		Middle Eastern people,  precisely  because they were raised
		to use toilet paper.  Unless you thoroughly wash your hands
		after each trip to the toilet, you might soon  regret  your
		preference for this new  experience.  Also note that Middle
		Eastern   people  do  this  with  their  left   hands,  and
		*everything  else* with their right hands  (hence  reducing
		the infection  risks), whereas  Westerners tend to use both
		hands indiscriminately.]

Turkish classical and traditional  music; we brought back a number of tapes
and CDs (as well as a saz).  It's a shame that this aspect of Turkey's rich
culture is so little known in the West.
