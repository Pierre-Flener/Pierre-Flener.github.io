<H3>8 September 1993</H3>					

So I'm in Ankara now.  The journey to Venice was trouble-free, and the
ferry-trip to izmir a delight, with a very impressive passage through the
Channel of Corinth.  Then, you've certainly heard by now of the bizarre
stranger who crossed the superb Western Anatolian countryside in his car,
listening to (and loudly singing) Anatolian songs?!  Miraculously, I only
had one flat tire, and avoided at least 25 fatal accidents in 600km (they
drive like crazy over here)...

<P>Ankara is a city with two faces:  on the one hand, there are super-modern
parts where you'd think you are in a Western metropolis; on the other hand,
you may easily step back by one century, almost without transition.  There
are many parks, and streets are always bustling with people.  The internal
economy is very competitive, and you can buy everything here, during very
long opening hours.  Turkish products/imitations are about 3 times cheaper
than back home, but imported goods are up to 3 times more expensive...  The
weather?  About 28C during the days, constant blue skies, very agreeable
evenings, fresh nights.  Turkish cuisine is absolutely living up to its
reputation as one of the three finest in the world:  appetizers ("mezeler")
and deserts (hmmm, what gorgeous pastry!)  are terrific.

<H3>30 September 1993</H3>

Ankara remains a very pleasant surprise:  it's astoundingly green,
considering the bleak countryside all around.  And they seem to have
subscribed to sunshine here!  But they tell me that temps will drop very
soon...

<P>Contrary to my ekspectations, US imports are sometimes cheaper here than
in Europe.  Such is the case with CDs (about US$13 on imports, and US$8 on
local CDs)!  Together with the world-class clothing industry, and some
other items, you can easily pay off a trip to Turkey with some
well-targeted shopping!  Twinkle, twinkle!

<P>The other day, while shopping for equipping my apt, I was looking for a
power ekstension cord.  The shop only had these industry- size 10m cords
with half a dozen jacks lined up at one end, which I didn't need.  So I
decided to build my own:  the cord was easy enough to find, and so was the
male jack, but then, hard as I was looking, I couldn't find any female
jacks for the other end!  Only then did I remember that the supermarket I
was in is under the Kocattepe Mosque, the biggest mosque of the Middle-East
(and one of the world's largest to boot):  so maybe the female jacks are
veiled!?  I never found out, but spotted a convenient cord at some bazaar.

<P>Another strange fact is that change is consistently in short supply
wherever I buy something.  So I often leave involuntary "tips" because the
price has to be rounded up.  What drives me mad is that this often happens
at places where one only buys small things, so chances are that quite a few
people are able to give the correct change when paying:  but why and where
does this change disappear until the nekst customer (usually I ;-) comes?
This is BTW a quite common phenomenon in non-Western countries, but I never
understood what laws of physics/statistics make change unavailable when
<I>I</I> need it.  Maybe it's only a dumb effort at ripping-off customers,
and thus rounding up one's salary?

<P>I finally went through my first diarrhea, though it wasn't fun at all.
So I'm set now for drinking tap water!  Although my apt has European-style
toilets, such isn't the case everywhere.  Sometimes, there are only these
hole-in-the-ground squat toilets:  if we had these back home, I wouldn't
have needed any rehab eksercises after my knee surgery!

<P>The big frustration is of course the language:  it's very annoying when
you don't understand anything on radio / TV / newspapers / commercials /
wrappings / instructions, and so on.  Although my phrase-book is invaluable
as a guide for conversation with those who know bits of English/French, I
of course signed up for a beginners' level course in Turkish at my
university; it's a matter of courtesy to my host country, and of sheer
survival.  I have to admit however that there is a daily Turkish newspaper
in English, and that one Turkish radio channel broadcasts news in English /
French/German about 5 times a day.  Once I have TV and cable, I'll also
have quite a few Western channels, including RTL, though nobody seems to
know what the "L" stands for :-(.  Some newsstands have an incredible array
of Western dailies/weeklies/monthlies, though at much inflated prices.

<P>Oh, and for those who are worried about my "emotional status" in Muslim
land:  large parts of Ankara, and especially the campuses of my university,
seem to be "anti-fundamentalist" enclaves in a country that is fairly
secular anyway.  So don't worry:  decolletes are in the average as deep as
in the West, skirts are in the average as short as in the West, blouses are
in the average as tight as in the West.  Even better:  Turkish women tend
to be ekstremely cute...

<P>As you noticed by now, the Turkish alphabet doesn't have the letter "x",
so I have to type "ks", as in "Taksi", as a workaround.  Ooops ;-)

<H3>16 December 1993</H3>

<P>An important remark to my Turkish friends:  some of the material in
these diaries may sound offensive to you, or may reflect on things you
might prefer people outside Turkey do not know about.  But note that I
profoundly love your country (otherwise I wouldn't have come here in the
first place), and yet I want to be completely honest and mention all the
things that clash with my Western values:  sometimes, things are hard to
swallow for Westerners, but don't forget that at other times (as you very
well know) Turkey easily tops Western societies, and that I do mention
these things as well!

<P>The fall was extremely short for local standards (maybe one week), and
we now have temperatures around 0C (down from around 28C).  It snows
occasionally, and it rains even less, and the sun luckily persists in
keeping the sky blue, despite the cold.  All in all, I'm quite happy with
the weather here, one of my minor objectives having been to escape the
grey, rainy, and cloudy falls, winters, and springs of back home.

<P>In the summer, Central Anatolia is a pretty dry and hot region, so there
are not many natural occurrences of the green color.  Luckily (FYI:  green
is my favorite color), municipal and campus authorities have this obsession
of growing grass everywhere:  hence you'll see entire armies of men
watering grassy patches so as to keep them alive, especially in the
evenings.  Thank you, Turkey, for catering to my visual needs!

<P>Close to campus, I located this MOBIL gas-station (free advertisement)
where unleaded gas <I>is</I> available (many stations announce having some,
but are consistently short of it when you get there).  So that's one good
reason to go there.  One of the other two good reasons is that MOBIL is the
first (& only?)  company in Turkey to employ girls (some of them quite
pretty) as outdoors personnel at the pumps!  (Self-service seems to be an
unknown concept here, for the obvious reason that such practice would
increase unemployment.  As an aside, sometimes it seems to me that
unemployment is not really existent here, as people always find ways of
self-employing themselves in all kinds of inventive ways.)  Now on to the
third good reason to fuel up at that station:  if you purchase at least 20
liters, they'll wash your car for free, on the spot!  This is a quite nifty
feature, as the air is so dust-laden here that your car will always look
like coming straight off the Paris-Dakar rally, even though you had it
washed 3 days before and let it stand idle!

<P>So I went to the airport one day to find out where it is, how to find my
way back (not obvious), and where/how to pick friends up when they come to
visit me.  The road took me through an impressive time-warp:  first the
modern high-rise sections of Ankara, and then a long string of so-called
"gecekondu" villages.  Houses are built in one night ("gece") there, with
people taking advantage of a centuries-old Ottoman law stating that such
houses may not be demolished by the government.  So there is no real urban
planning in such suburbs (and they are huuuge), and conditions of life are
quite miserable compared to the rest of the city.  Some upperclass Turks
are quite ashamed of the existence of these villages, and they will try to
divert you from seeing them, or will express outright shock when you tell
them you've been there for a walk (as they would never be caught dead in
such sections of the town).  Many people would call these slums, but you
may also view them as villages near the city, and they are definitely much
more representative of the average Turk's lifestyle than the Beverly
Hills-like sections some would want us foreigners to spend all our lives
in.  I think no Westerner comes to work in Turkey to see how the very few
gilded rich live (namely often in reckless imitation of what's going on in
the West), because that's nothing new to them, nor to restrict her/his life
to such a life, because s/he can have the same life back home, or even a
better one.  We have an interesting conflict of interests here:  the
academics of my university are relatively well-off (and some of the
students are outrageously well-off), and don't really seem to bother about
the rest of the nation, which is precisely what we foreigners are here for!
Turkish society (still) is sooo different from Western ones, especially if
you drop the richer 1% of the population:  people are really friendly and
hospitable here; they'll go out of their ways to help you; they haven't
succumbed (yet) to the all-out int'l frenzy of
money-making/modernization/competitiveness/etc; they are easy-going and
fun-loving; and so on.  (I'm _not_ saying the well-off people don't fit
this general scheme.)  Granted, some aspects deserve improvement, or are
hard to accept for people who have been brainwashed in different ways, but
things are very likeable the way they are!  Of course, the upper 1% will
define this state as backwardness/underdevelopment, but do they really have
to impose Western ways onto a Middle-Eastern nation?  do we really have to
make this world a global village of McDonalds+MTV junkies?  I'm fully aware
that these ideas may be misconstrued as spitting into the hands that feed
me, and that I probably wouldn't like to live in a "gecekondu", but, hey,
I'm just succumbing to the many contradictions of the Middle-East.  Back to
the airport-story (which was just a pretext to convey the ideas above):
the airport is a pretty impressive affair, it reminded me a lot of the
Luxembourg-City International Airport (to outsiders:  this is a joke!).

<P>Hey, I found a way to become rich very fast:  the Luxembourg Frank (LUF)
has a slightly better exchange rate here than the Belgian Frank (BEF).
Don't ask me how come, I'm flabbergasted as well, because both currencies
are identical by definition.  But I'm happy that at least one country
recognizes that the Luxembourg economy is doing better than the Belgian
one.  ;-)

<P>I have a TV now, though no cable TV yet.  But the rooftop antenna on my
apt building already provides me with 14 channels, all Turkish, except MTV.
So I left the thing running for quite a while, and zapped a lot, so as to
figure out what's turning people on here.  As a sports enthusiast, I get
more than my share:  Turkish league games in soccer and basketball are
plentiful; on top of that I can see selected league games in soccer from
Italy, Spain, England, and Germany; plus many European Cup games in both
sports; 3 NCAA basketball games per week (yeah!  the fore-span features a
Thomas Hill slam-dunk, go Devils!), and 1 NBA game per week.

<P>Otherwise, as in any country, the result is pretty sad.  Beyond the
imported (and dubbed) movies and soap-operas, there are a lot of Turkish
productions (which I cannot judge, due to my lack of understanding of the
language), many musical shows (some with excellent classical Turkish music
renderings), and some really silly shows that seem to have no content at
all, but rather be rea- sons to show off some cute Turkish maidens in
skin-tight dresses hopping around like North-American cheerleaders at every
opportunity.  In the few years since my first trip to Turkey (1986), this
country seems to have slipped from one extreme to the other:  from a total
ban (?)  on published erotica to very lax standards, and to public
debasement of women in the media.  (Here I'm on very slippery terrain, but
let me push ahead anyway.)  The apparent contradiction in all these shows
is that whenever the camera swerves over to prove that the audience in the
studio is having a good time, you would expect to see a male-only crowd.
But no, there are many women, and they seem to enjoy themselves!  Even
better, quite a few of these women wear headscarves (not the full veil),
and thus wouldn't be caught dead while showing some of their hair to men,
and yet they seem to thoroughly enjoy themselves while some other women on
stage show quite a bit more than their hair...  Go and figure that one out!
The only theory I could come up with (after discussing this with some
Turkish women-friends here) is that Turkish society is divided into two
parts, regarding the classification of women:  on the one hand, you have
the family world, where women are expected to be faithful, obedient wives,
mothers, cooks, and cleaning staff; and on the other hand, you have the
men's world, where women are for "entertainment" only.  These two worlds do
not intersect, and wife-women perceive the entertainment-women as mere
objects (!), thus with no virtue, and hence not as despicable beings, and
they even tolerate/encourage men to have fun in their world.  For the same
reasons, prostitution is legal here (provided under police and medical
supervision), because the object-women allow the wife-women to preserve
their virtue.  Cover-girls (even on most serious daily newspapers), the
girls of many commercials and of some of these shows, many female singers,
many actresses, all belly-dancers, etc.  definitely seem to belong to the
men's world only, and are said to make tons of money.  I'm afraid though
that I'm just scratching the surface here with my current understanding of
what's going on here.

<P>The other thing that bugs me with local TV channels is that they are
often geared towards the rich (many commercials advertise things most
people can only dream of, and the audiences in the studios always look
rather well-off), and that the name of the game often is a mere imitation
of Western TV:  local bands play Western instruments and compose Western
beats into their songs, teenagers dance Western steps & dances during
concerts, and girls shriek just like the hysterical groupies back home,
local orchestras play Western symphonies, everybody is dressed up in
Western ways, and so on.  These people are entirely throwing away their own
culture, and probably are MTV addicts.  I just plainly refuse to believe
that Western culture is universal in the sense that it appeals to
everybody, regardless of what corner of the Earth one is coming from.  I'm
not saying they shouldn't enjoy Western culture (after all, I like some of
the Turkish classical music quite a lot), but they seem to do this with a
reckless abandonment that frightens me (after all, back home, people don't
go in droves to concerts with Turkish classical music).  If the West is the
best, as they say, why do Westerners run away from there?  Not everything
is perfect in the West (as we all know), so what point is there to abandon
one's culture because of some apparent deficiencies and to entirely embrace
another one with its own, new deficiencies?  OK, it's hard to convince them
of their errors.  Moreover, Kemalism itself (a doctrine named after Mustafa
Kemal, the 1st president of the modern Republic of Turkey) shows that this
is the way to go (some of his first laws were the prohibition of some
traditional garb, which was then considered an outward sign of
backwardness).  I think there is a lot of mental underdevelopment in the
minds of those who think Turkey should throw everything overboard and
emulate the West:  it's not outward signs such as fashion, music, etc.
that translate underdevelopment!  Nor is it necessarily inner values that
do so.  The whole problem is:  what is underdevelopment?  what is
civilization?  I think there are no absolute definitions of these concepts,
so why should we start comparing cultures/societies in terms of such
criteria?  But again, I'm afraid I'm off the mark with my current
understanding of what's going on here.

<P><I>Question</I>: How many PTT workers does it take to get a parcel from  abroad
through to you?  (PTT = Turkish Post and Telecommunications)

<P><I>Answer</I>: 17,
<ul>
<li>	1 to receive the parcel from the airport;</li>
<li>	1 to write a pink slip that there is a parcel for you at the PTT;</li>
<li>	1 to deliver the pink slip to you;  (now you go to the PTT)</li>
<li>	1 to open the guarded door to the PTT, and re-open it when you leave;</li>
<li>	1 to whom to give the pink slip at the international desk;</li>
<li>	1 to help you in the whole process, because he speaks English, and
		because it's easy to get lost with the next things to do;</li>
<li>	1 to verify that you really are the addressee;</li>
<li>	1 to tell you that you are in the wrong office;</li>
<li>	1 to tell you that after all you were in the right office;</li>
<li>	1 to fetch the parcel from the storage room;</li>
<li>	1 to open the parcel (in front of everybody!), and to close it later;</li>
<li>	1 to search the contents for offending/illegal/... materials;</li>
<li>	1 to write a white slip that the parcel is OK, and to charge you
		an arbitrary amount for importing its contents;</li>
<li>	1 to re-verify that you are the addressee, and to stamp the white slip;</li>
<li>	1 to counter-sign the stamp on the white slip;</li>
<li>	1 to verify the counter-signature on the white slip, and to counter-
		counter-sign it (honestly!, but sorry, the loop stops here...);</li>
<li>	1 to show the duly stamped & signed white slip to, at the
		international desk again, but who can't find your parcel
		any more (this one is actually the same one as above);</li>
<li>	1 to re-locate your now closed parcel in the storage room,
		and finally to deliver it to you.   (whew!)</li>
</ul>

<P>NB. This is NOT a joke.
The whole process (home --> PTT --> home) takes me about 2.5 hours...

<P>Moral of the story:  when you feel the strong urge to send me presents,
please either (a) send them DHL/FedEx/..., or (b) put them into a standard
envelope and write "Book/Livre/Buch/Kitap" all over it, or (c) refrain from
doing it and laud yourself on your good intentions.  Seriously, I'm NOT
going to pick up anything at that place again.

<P>Did you know that Santa Claus (or St. Nicholas, the patron saint of
children, students, unmarried girls, sailors, and ... thieves(!)) was born
in Turkey?  Did you know that Mary (the mother of Jesus) is believed by
many to have died in Turkey,
near Efes (formerly Ephesus, a well-known place to those who've read the
New Testament)?  Many other biblical/Christian personalities and sites are
spread all across Turkey, making this country much more of a religious
crossroads than many would want to believe.  More samples?  Mt. Ararat,
where Noah is said to have stepped off the Ark after the Deluge, is in
Turkey.  Some of the earliest Christian communities lived in Anatolia, and
went into hiding in the out-of-this-world landscape of Cappadocia when Arab
raiders swarmed into the area.  Their underground and troglodyte cities
feature some of the most beautiful Byzantine art.  istanbul is of course
THE treasure-house of Byzantine art.

<P>Of course, today, Turkey is a predominantly Muslim country.  For
instance, Mevlana, the Afghan Islamic mystic (Sufi, actually) who lived and
died in Konya, wrote books that are among the most influential ones of
Islam right after the Qu'ran and the Hadeeth (an account of the life of the
prophet Mohammed).  His preaching of equality of all people, regardless of
their sex, race, or religion, ought to be mandatory reading everywhere.  I
even heard that the Turkish women's liberation movement quotes him (gasp!)
as one of their forerunners!

<P>Last Sunday, I went to Konya to watch the world-famous performance of
the "Whirling Dervishes" of the local Mevlana order.  This dance is
performed in memory of Mevlana's death-day, and is a religious dance, not a
folk dance.  Also, it is a meditation dance, not a dance to show off and
make converts.  It was a very impressive event.  A small orchestra performs
some very mystical music on traditional instruments (especially the "ney"
flute), and accompanies a choir.  After a while, the head of the order
steps forward, followed by the dancers, and they ceremoniously shuffle
around in a large circle in a very dignified and meditative way.
Eventually, the dancers one-by-one get their "blessings" from their leader
and start whirling around.  First, they make a few spins with their arms
crossed over their chest, and then they extend their arms (one hand facing
the sky, the other hand facing the earth) and start spinning around the
square, their ample white robes floating around their bodies.  The rotation
speed is quite high, and this goes on, with short interruptions, for over
an hour!  It is quite amazing that nobody fainted or even stumbled, even
though some of the dancers looked quite old.  A breathtaking performance!
I also visited the Mevlana Museum, a highlight of every trip to Turkey with
its masterpieces of Islamic Art.
