<H2>Introduction</H2>

This is a report of a solo-trip to Iran, undertaken during July 1996
[please note that this was way before the election of Khatami].  I have
compiled it from my travel notes, often omitting irrelevant details such as
where I ate what, where I slept, and so on, but adding some afterthoughts
and hindsights.  I am from Luxembourg, so expect a slightly European
mind-set, but maybe tainted by the fact that I actually lived in Turkey.

<P>This journey was totally improvised, reservations being a concept
totally alien to me.  Of course I did some homework beforehand, so as to
know the must-sees.  My only available information source was the Lonely
Planet guide "Iran - A Travel Survival Kit (1st edition)" (Australia, 1991,
by David St Vincent:  a great book, but aging badly; fortunately, new
editions are always in the making).  Descriptions are kept informative
enough so that those who have been there should recognize the places, while
those who would like to go there should be able to locate them.  This
report is not intended to be a crash course on Iranian history and culture.

<P>This journey also was on a shoestring budget, a mattress to crash on and
a shower being all that is needed when constantly on the move.  Visa costs,
transportation to/from the Iranian border, inoculations, medicine,
postcards, and souvenirs excluded, I had a daily maintenance ratio of about
$7.5, covering accommodation, food, drinks, transportation, and entrance
fees.  This was a little bit roughing it sometimes, so reckon on $10 per
day for a really cozy trip!

<P>All views expressed here are mine, and you are the judge whether they
are witty insights, total misunderstandings, or unspeakable truths.  Note
that all Iranian names have been changed, to "protect" the people I met.

<P>Comments are welcome.

<P>Enjoy,<BR>

<H2>30 June 1996: From the Turkey/Iran border to Tehran</H2>

At dawn, my Turkish bus follows the ancient Silk Road through a corridor
between the windswept craggy hills of the Eastern Anatolian plateau, along
a meandering river fed by the last silvery patches of snow.  Near
DoGubeyazit, the last Turkish outpost, Mount Ararat takes command of the
scenery with its imposing 5,185m height and its eternal snowcap.  Almost
everybody gets off in that village, and it is only a few Turkish women --
all married to Iranian Azaris -- and their kids who accompany me to the
border.  When we get there, headscarves and black chadors are taken out of
bags and adjusted, and we say goodbye to our friendly bus crew of the last
17 hours.

<P>The exit formalities on the Turkish side are very fast, but the Iranian
side is a bit chaotic, with papers to fill out, closed doors to wait at,
and huge queues.  I team up with two young Iranian Azaris, let us call them
Akbar I and Akbar II, who are returning to Tehran from a brief vacation in
Ankara.  They are resourceful enough to "talk me" past all queues and even
to talk the customs officer into "neglecting" his duty of having me fill in
a currency declaration.

<P>So, after only 2.5 hours, we emerge in Iran.  I feel elated to finally
be here, after four failed attempts to even get the visa.  Judging from the
state of the vehicles and buildings, my very first impression is that I
somehow seem to be thrown 20 years back in time, as if nothing had been
done over these 20 years, but this was going to be my last "negative"
observation about Iran.  The Akbars continue to take charge of my progress,
thus giving me a smooth introduction to their country, since I do not speak
any Farsi language yet, although my Turkish gets me around with the Azari
and Turkmen people, and cannot read the alphabet yet, except for the
digits.  We change cash dollars into Rials at the black market, at a hugely
profitable margin compared to the official bank rate.

<P>We then negotiate the fare for a "savari" (collective taxi) ride east to
Tabriz, together with some businessman.  The driver initially wants 9,000
Rials [I am unsure of the amount right now, but the proportions to the
next-mentioned amounts are correct], but my co-travelers quickly haggle him
down to 6,000 Rials, where the negotiation stagnates, although we want it
to continue down to 4,000 Rials.  "So what", says the driver in Azari to
the Akbars, "that foreigner is certainly rich, so do not tell him anything
about the real price and make him pay 3,000 Rials, while each of you three
gives me 1,000 Rials!"  Without taking into account that I had actually
understood all this, due to my basic Turkish, the Akbars explode and
chastise the driver for even thinking of such a deal, as they would of
course divide the fare exactly by four.  I also say a few friendly words in
Turkish to the driver, who shrivels and reduces the fare to the desired
4,000 Rials!  I will have several other such occasions where Iranians
defend my right to pay the same price as them, even though the government
sets a bad example by systematically and "officially" over-charging
foreigners in hotels and museums (and I will not even talk more about taxi
drivers, who, like their brethren all over the non-taximetered world, are
the biggest self-inflicted curse of humanity).  On we go!  The road itself
is in perfect shape, and this will be a constant observation throughout the
country, but it takes us through godforsaken dry and dusty land; this is
also true for much, but by far not all, of Iran.

<P>In Tabriz, the Akbars bid me goodbye and head for the airport to catch a
flight to Tehran, whereas I head to the bus terminal.  Hadi, a student,
chats with me in flawless French, assists me in buying a ticket to Tehran,
and stays with me until the departure of his bus.  I like the naive English
inscriptions on some buses, such as "We go to good bay" (sic) and "My
beautifule buse" (sic).  Then I just linger at the terminal lounge, waiting
for my own bus at 8pm, and waiting for the Akbars!  And, sure as hell, here
they are, not having been able to secure tickets for the last flight, just
as I had predicted, even though I have no experience with Iran Air -- my
gut feeling was that you just cannot go the airport 20 minutes before a
flight and get a ticket!  Once we all have tickets for the same bus, we
have dinner at the terminal restaurant, for my first "chelo kebab" in a
long series, and then leave southeast on the bus, at sunset.

<P>Not long afterwards, the bus repeatedly breaks down for short whiles,
sometimes even creeping around at 20km/h, and eventually we have to leave
it, flag down another bus, and pile into its remaining empty seats.  There
goes the comfort of our 27-seater, as we now have to spend the rest of the
night in extreme discomfort on a cramped bus.  Luckily, my time-tested
technique of simply stretching out on the floor comes in handily here, but
do not tell my boss...

<H2>1 - 3 July 1996: Tehran</H2>

At about 7am, we pull into Tehran's West Terminal, near Azadi Square with
its imposing Azadi (Freedom) Arch.  The Akbars help me find a
"mosaferkhune" (travelers' hostel) to my taste and budget, just off
Topkhune Square downtown, and then return to their families.  Tehran turns
out to be a monstrously large and ugly city, overcrowded and extremely
polluted:  I thus instinctively dislike it, but I have been on the road for
almost 48 hours and 2,000km now, so I need a rest, not to mention that
Tehran has the best museums of the country.

<P>But first I visit Sogol Tour & Travel, whose agent Azadeh had sponsored
my tourist visa and was very efficient and reliable throughout that
procedure.  She is a very attractive young lady, dressed in a black chador
like her female colleagues and like most (but not all!)  other women in the
country, and patiently answers my many information-hungry first questions
about Tehran, over a cup of tea of course.  It is then time for me to fly
on my own wings now, with the Akbars' and Azadeh's wind underneath.  So I
set out for a restaurant that she recommended, its address written in neat
script on a piece of paper.

<P>Over the next two and a half days, I visit Tehran, often on foot, so as
to get my bearings about life in Iran, such as hailing a taxi or a
"savari", making phone calls (to friends' friends), asking for directions,
figuring out the correct prices of things, etc.  It is a bit disconcerting
at first, especially that the loathsome pollution really weighs on you, not
to mention the additional effect of the heat.  But there is a whole country
and culture to finally discover, and this prospect thrills me.

<P>Memorable sights include the beautiful Park-e Lale with the fabulous
Muze-ye Farsh (carpet museum), the magnificent Muze-ye Abgine (glass and
ceramics museum), and the mind-bending National Museum of Iran, which
covers no less than 10,000 years of history.  The main bazaar is enormous
and teeming, and would probably rank very prominently in any "Westerner's"
memoirs of a trip to Tehran, but I have been to too many Islamic countries
to get a real kick out of this one.  Another remarkable sight was the
Armenian cathedral of St Sarkiz, of course with a huge Khomeini mural right
next door.  Armenian Christians, as well as other religious minorities,
(seem to) have full religious rights, a somewhat surprising fact
considering the fundamentalist reputation of the Shi'ite regime.  The
former US Embassy sports a "Down with USA" graffiti on its wall and is now
simply called "The Center for the Publication of the U.S.  Espionage Den's
Documents" (sic).  In front of it is a same-named bookstore where you can
buy, for a few cents, copies of painstakingly re-assembled shredded
documents, with highly classified CIA material (vintage pre '79).  They
look too good, and the English is too perfect, to be fake.  I buy a volume
with a top-secret CIA description of the Israeli Mossad and a biography of
Yitzhak Rabin...

<H3>Traffic</H3>

I have often ranted about traffic in Turkey (which is where I live), but
now that I have been to Iran, I have enormous respect for the "discipline"
of Turkish drivers.  They are choirboys compared to their Iranian brothers!
I completely lack the words to describe the chaos of an Iranian city,
especially Tehran, where cars shoot around in gay abandon, filling
literally every millimeter of the road, disrespecting every sign and light
(many traffic lights are actually switched to a permanently blinking
yellow, and often lack the red and green lenses altogether), honking
ferociously, and committing many other horrors.  And there are bicycles and
motorbikes on this battlefield, often even driving up roads on opposing
lanes, or invading the sidewalks and covered bazaars, thus extending the
jurisdiction of the Jungle Law.  Now, do you really want to know where and
how pedestrians fit into all this?!  When I left the bus terminal and
crossed a wide boulevard with the Akbars, weaving lane by lane through
dense traffic, and somehow making it to the other side unscathed, I turned
around with a proud look on my face, fully expecting the pedestrian crowds
to cheer "ole, ole, ole" and make Mexican waves on the sidewalks!  But no,
there was no reaction:  I had just learned the first survival skill that
every infant in Iran seems to acquire (or not, judging from the limping
masses).  Watching Latino toreros doesn't give me any thrills anymore, as
they only face <I>one</I> bull.  Crossing a Tehran street is the real
thing, for real men!  Forget the traffic in Athens, Rome, Cairo, and
Istanbul, forget Russian roulette and bungee jumping:  Tehran traffic gives
you the ultimate adrenaline rushes!

<H2>4 - 6 July 1996: Esfahan</H2>

A few unpleasant moments precede the departure of my night bus to Esfahan.
The clerk who booked my reservation the day before, and who spoke fluent
English, made a mistake and wrote the wrong date onto my ticket, and I did
not realize this either, as the date is written in the Islamic calendar.
When somebody rightfully claims my seat, the driver comes up and tells me
in good but rude English that I should get off the bus.  I protest and ask
for a "solution" to my problem (it was the clerk's fault, it is very late
and dark, and this is the last bus) before I will get off.  Then he gets
really upset, asks me where I am from, tells me to act in as civilized a
way as Europeans always pretend to do, and orders me not to downplay Iran's
civilization any more.  Bewildered, but politely, I tell him that I never
attacked Iran or anybody in my protest, that all this has nothing to do
with civilization, etc, and that there certainly is a "solution" (thinking
that we are in Iran, after all).  The driver's mood now gets really ugly,
but a few passengers raise to my defense, and excitedly argue with him.
Eventually, I can keep my seat, the claimant gets seated somewhere else (so
why all the fuss?), and I am asked to "compensate" for the driver's ire
with a small "bakhsheesh"!  Oh well, I guess I have to play it
Iranian-style to the end, and the "gift" is less than spending another
night in some pension in Tehran anyway.

<P>The bus south to the Silk Road city of Esfahan is a superfast brandnew
Volvo, rather than the usual slow old Mercedes, so we arrive at 3am,
instead of the 6am or so I was told.  While everybody bustles away, I open
my guidebook for orientation, still rubbing my eyes from sleep.  Just as I
am about to despair and settle in the park until sunrise, help pops up in
the friendly person of Hassan, a graduate student at a local university.  A
taxi-ride to downtown soon confirms his suspicion that hotels have no
reception service at this time of the night; this being Iran, Hassan simply
invites me to his parents' home, somewhere in the Armenian quarter!  This
nightly taxi ride through empty streets raises my spirits, as Esfahan turns
out to be at least as beautiful as in all the travelers' reports I had read
so far:  I immediately feel that I will resonate with this splendid city,
so I fall asleep happily.

<P>Indeed, I spend a memorable three days in Esfahan, unable to understand
why Esfahanis have such a negative reputation among fellow Iranians.
Hassan and other youngsters-turned-voluntary-guides alternate showing me
around town, providing for great conversation and learning, for relaxing
moments at the landmark bridges over the Zayande Rud and in the parks along
the borders of this river, and for visits of mindboggling sites.  Thank you
Hassan, Said, Ali, Parriz, and many others, for sharing with me the beauty
of your city!

<P>The absolute highlight is the unsurpassably beautiful Meydun-e Emam
Khomeini square, which is surrounded by sumptuous mosques (Masjed-e Emam
and Masjed-e Sheikh Lotfollah) that feature exquisite tilework, a nice
palace (Kakh-e Ali Khapu), and a teeming bazaar.  Also memorable are the
elegant tree-lined Kheyabun Chahar Bagh alley, the splendid Abbasi Hotel
compound, the cute Chehel Sotun (Forty Columns) reception hall in front of
a pool in a shaded park, the relaxing Hasht Behesht (Eight Paradises) park,
where I once got "abducted" for breakfast on a blanket by enthusiastic
young Azari Iranians, as well as the Si-o-Se Pol (Thirty-three Arches) and
Pol-e Khaju pedestrian-only bridges, where most of the social life of the
city seems to be going on, with all these shaded tea-houses located under
their arches, and hence refreshingly at water level.  I spend hours there,
just lingering around, and an obvious target for a chat.  In the suburbs, I
visit the Armenian Kelisa-ye Vank (church) of the Jolfa district, with its
ghastly paintings of martyred saints (why are many religions so fascinated
with violence?)  and posters asking the Turkish government to acknowledge
the (alleged) 1915 massacres, and, last but not least, the swinging (yes!)
minarets of the Manar Jomban mausoleum:  just climb up, clasp the outer
wall by reaching through the windows, and rock the minaret while leaning on
the inner wall:  it goes back and forth by about 5cm!

<H3>Food and Drinks</H3>

Iranian food is excellent and wholesome, but it is hard to come by the best
items on the menu:  this seems to require an invitation to somebody's home.
Beside the ubiquitous "chelo kebab" (kebab on a rice bed) and the even more
pervasive sandwich (of pre-Americanization times, I am told, except for the
hamburgers), I sampled a few other things and came to like various forms of
"khoresht" most, followed by "abgusht", and other, less frequent variations
of kebab.  Restaurants seem to be having a bad time, and I was often
(almost) the only guest in a large room, as everybody went for the much
cheaper sandwiches.  Fruits and vegetables are very tasty, definitely some
of the best I ever had!  And, as all over the Middle East, deserts give you
a taste of what angels eat in paradise.

<P>In terms of drinks, Iran must be the most coca-colonized country in the
world:  in 95% of the places, you are not even asked whether you want Coke
or not, and it is close to being the only choice other than water!
Amazing, no, that the government tries to convince everybody that the
"West" and its inventions are the Great Satan, whereas hamburgers and Coke
are so pervasive!?  Interestingly, one of the local imitations of Coke is
called Zam-Zam, after the sacred source near Mecca:  is it not astounding
that the Muslim clerics tolerate this defamation?  Caffeine seems to have
absolutely no effect on Iranians, since they are caffeine-trained from
earliest age:  I saw eight-year-olds drink Coke at 11pm and yet fall asleep
thirty minutes later!  So when I, as a "Westerner", declared not wanting
Coke, they stared at me as if I was the biggest idiot this side of the
universe...  Similarly, as a European, I found it quite amusing to see
grown-up men have soft-drinks, like Fanta or so, because, needless to say,
Iran is a completely "dry" country (but see below).  So next comes water;
tap water is usually excellent (it comes straight from the mountains in
most cases), and is also pervasive:  in order to keep a promise in return
for a wish come true, shop owners set up water-reservoirs on the sidewalks,
so that pedestrians never go thirsty.  Similarly on buses; as a rule, you
never have to carry water, but may want to carry a cup so that you do not
have to use the community glass.  Unfortunately, many if not most Iranians
seem to have forgotten the tradition of drinking hot tea in hot weather,
which is definitely healthier than the ice-cold soft-drinks and water that
are being served everywhere.  On to the highlights of the Iranian drink
charts:  addictively savory fruit or vegetable juices are freshly pressed
for you at "vitamin-stations" just about everywhere, "chay" (tea) is still
being served in "chaykhune"s (teahouses), and "dugh", the local variant of
Turkish "ayran" or Indian "lassi" (water and yogurt mix), is another
effective thirst quencher.  Islamic beer is only a distant relative of the
real thing, of which you will start phantasizing after about one week.  No
wine, no spirits either, at least on the surface.  But Iran being Iran,
with Christians and Jews having the right to produce alcohol for their
religious services, it goes without saying that they produce more than
needed...  You catch my drift:  everything is available, if you manage to
get the right people to trust you.

<H2>7 - 10 July 1996: Shiraz</H2>

While on the bus south to Shiraz, a man and his family in the front row
keep gesturing at me to join them there.  So I eventually take a seat
vacated by a son, and the father starts the conversation in halting
English:

<P> - We are very honored to have you aboard this bus, Sir.   [...]

<P>During the usual smalltalk enquiries about my opinions of Iran and the
Iranians, the other passengers stir in their seats and stare at us, maybe
eager to find out about me.  Then:

<P>  - What is your name?
<BR> - Pierre.

<P>Somebody tips on his shoulder and asks, in Farsi, what my name is.
After his reply, the word "Pierre" goes like a bushfire to the end of the
bus, so I turn around and gently bow forward, with a friendly smile, now
that I am officially introduced.

<P>  - What is your surname?
<BR> - Flener.

<P>And a "Flener" sound soon ripples through the entire bus.

<P>  - Where are you from?
<BR> - I am from Luxemborg.   (sic, Farsi pronunciation)

<P>Now, the words "Luxemborg!", "Luxemborg?", and "Istanbul!"  (sic)
resonate around.

<P>  - What is your job?
<BR> - I am a teacher.
<BR> - Are you an English language teacher?
<BR> - No, I teach Computer Science.
<BR> - Wow!  At what level, high school perhaps?
<BR> - No, at a university.
<BR> - But you are very young...  Are you a teaching assistant?
<BR> - No, I have a Ph.D. degree and am an assistant professor.

<P>The eager man behind us tips on my neighbor's shoulder again to get the
summary of my latest answers.  And the word "doktora" echoes manifold
through the bus, to be instantly followed by an almost collective outcry:

<P> - Mashallah!   (a common Islamic phrase, used to avert the evil eye
                    when expressing admiration)

<P>Their admiration seems limitless.  (Later I found out that, with the
level of the economy, obtaining a Ph.D.  in Iran is something very
difficult, and thus quite rare and noteworthy, especially for people of my
age.)  Passengers send their children to bring me cakes, fruit, vegetables,
and tea.  How natural Iranians thus are, in the sense that they simply
"adopt" me, making me one of theirs, with no regard to my race, creed, or
title!  I like this!

<P>The city of Shiraz is the other must-see on the Iranian part of the Silk
Road, although less exhibitionist and visual than Esfahan, but maybe more
poetic?  I spent four days there, and they were as busy and wonderful as my
days in Esfahan, for the same reasons:  many young people chatted with me,
abducted me for "faludeh" ice-cream (a local specialty), or otherwise
showed me around.  Unforgettable!  Enter Ali and Hadi, two young Iranians
visiting from somewhere near Tehran, and in town for the same time-span as
I.

<P>

<BR><BR>
		    -- ghazal by Hafez (1300-1389)
</CENTER>

<P>Among the most memorable sites are the various parks, including the ones
with Aramgah-e Hafez (the tomb of Hafez, the most celebrated poet of the
Farsi tongue) and Aramgah-e Sa'di (the tomb of Sa'di, another son of
Shiraz, and probably Iran's second-most famous poet).  The former park
features a lovely tea-garden where it feels so good to while away the
hotter hours of the day, listening to soulful classical Iranian music.  The
mausolea at Shah-e Cheragh, of Sayyed Mir Ahmad and his brother Sayyed Mir
Mohammad (close relatives of Emam Reza), are especially interesting, not
only for the throngs of pilgrims shuffling through and donating impressive
amounts of Rials, but also and mainly for their dazzling three-dimensional
mirror mosaics inside:  you feel like walking through a diamond, or through
outer space, with all these myriads of reflections!  There also is a
generous sprinkling of other sites of interest, such as the Ark (citadel),
more mosques and madrassas and churches, a small museum, and of course the
lively bazaars.

<P>As my two-week travel visa is about to expire, I also head out to the
police station in order to ask for a two-week-extension.  This turns out to
be quite an experience as well, so let me delve on it.  The Alien Affairs
bureau is a bit hard to find, but once there, I am relieved to find out
that at least Colonel Masti speaks English.  There is a form to fill out in
duplicate (without carbon paper) and attach mug shots to, and then you are
sent out to queue up at an on-site branch of Bank Melli in order to pay
1,000 Rials (so no money to the police officers:  not much trust here?)
and to buy, believe it or not, a folder for your own file at an on-site
stationery shop.  Back to Colonel Masti with all these items, and ready for
the dreaded interview:  travelers reported to me that they were interviewed
on as interesting topics as "the achievements of the Islamic Revolution,
from 1979 to today" (!)  before being granted the extension.  As he scans
through my application, he finds the magic line about my job, and fifteen
minutes later I walk out of there with a promise for the requested
extension, having "only" been grilled on computer software and hardware!  I
may pick up my passport the morning after, and it is ready indeed.

<P>One afternoon, I set out with Ali and Hadi for Takht-e Jamsheed, better
but erroneously known in the "West" as Persepolis, and the number one
archeological site in the country.  First by minibus to Marvdasht, some
50km north, then on by taxi to the ruins.  An exorbitant 10,000 Rials are
extorted from foreigners, much to Ali and Hadi's surprise, then dismay and
shame, because it is 20 times more than what locals pay.  This kind of
discrimination is rampant in Iran (though the multiplier usually is around
2 or 3) and in many other countries, but I will always fight it.  Ali and
Hadi argue with the ticket officer on my behalf, exposing the absurdity of
the system:  it contradicts the government's [now old] line that tourism
money is not needed, and suffers from the fact that not all foreigners have
the same buying power, etc.  He is sympathetic, but says the government
forces him to charge me more (even though there is no video camera behind
his back verifying whether he really enforces it).  The ruins are awesome,
with their giant walls, columns, temples, statues, and so on, especially
the incredibly well-preserved 2,500-year-old reliefs, such as the "Parade
of Nations".  (Let the compared lengths of my harangue against the
ticketing practice and of my praise of the site not make you infer that the
hassle was the dominant moment of the day, because it really was the visit
of the ruins; but how can I describe in words what you ought to go out and
see for yourself?!)  When we walk out, Ali and Hadi argue once more with
the ticket officer, pointing out that all signs and explanations are in
Farsi, so that it is a shame to ask foreigners to pay more without even
offering them any service for it.  He sheepishly hands back 5,000 Rials,
obviously embarrassed now.  We also visit the impressive rock-hewn tombs of
Darius I, Xerxes, Artaxerxes, and Darius II at nearby Naghsh-e Rostam
(though I would now recommend going to the two sites in the opposite order,
so as to have better light conditions for photography).

<H3>Entertainment</H3>

During "Moharram", the Shi'ite mourning month, everything is gloomy in
Iran.  Indeed, black banners were all over, the people looked grim, there
was no rhythmic music from the tape stalls (except in Tabriz), the
amusement parks entertained the kids but no adults, the restaurants were
virtually all empty, etc.  A big favorite on sale just about everywhere
were posters depicting crying women and children (watch those big tears!),
probably mourning the loss of relatives in a recent war?  What a
fascination in the entire country with grief!  Maybe this stems from the
very roots of Shi'ite Islam, which is after all built upon the shoulders of
martyrs?

<P>So there is little entertainment other than hanging around with friends
or staying with the family (which is of course difficult for the transient
traveler).  Discreet dating seemed to be going on in pastry and ice-cream
parlors and tea gardens, but "going out" seemed limited to window-shopping
up and down the fancier boulevards.

<P>Of course, for those who can afford it, there is big-time underground
entertainment in family and friends circles, not unlike what was going on
in the USA during the Prohibition, according to what I hear:  I still
regret having turned down (for time and itinerary reasons) an invitation to
such a "decadent" party, as it would have provided a stark contrast to the
life of the lower classes that I observed every day.  Alcohol would most
likely have been available there, and there would have been unveiled women
to talk to, but it was not to be:  maybe another time?

<P>Iran has a vibrant and world-class movie scene (one of my all-time
favorite movies is an Iranian one, namely "Bashoo", and I also enjoyed the
"Madjid" series on a little boy growing up in Esfahan), but little (if not
nothing) thereof was visible on the streets:  movie theaters invariably
sported blood-and-tear-filled posters for Rambo-style flicks with
mustachioed bandana-wearing machos carrying blazing machine guns and crying
chadored ladies across battlefields...  And such rubbish seemed to attract
huge (male) crowds, maybe reminding them of heroism in the Iran-Iraq war?
It is sickening to see such bloodthirst kept alive, but to Iran's excuse it
must be said that this is a worldwide phenomenon.

<H2>11 July 1996: - Yazd</H2>

Heading northeast, into the desert, I reach Yazd, the world capital of
Zoroastrianism.  This religion is a monotheistic one, but considerably
predates Christianity and Islam.  Zoroastrians worship God in the form of
fire, but do not worship the fire itself.  Half of the world's remaining
Zoroastrians live in Iran (with seemingly full religious rights, as even
their women do not have to comply with the supposedly Islamic dresscode),
many of which reside in Yazd.  Indeed, their holiest fire temple, the
Ateshkade, is here.  A polite elderly Zoroastrian shows me around there,
explaining things in English, including of course the holy eternal flame.

<P>The city is full of prospective students from all over the province, as
the university entrance exam is the day after.  It thus turns out
completely impossible to secure a bed for the night, in any price category,
and many students tell me that they will actually have to sleep in the
parks.  At some "mosaferkhune", however, I talk the receptionist into
setting up a bed for me in the courtyard, for a steep discount of course,
as long as I have access to the common facilities.  Which he does, right in
the courtyard, where students mill around, pouring over their lecture
notes, cramming the last few theorems, and polishing their English up with
me as a last-minute God-sent recitation instructor.

<P>Similar things happen wherever I go in the city.  Interestingly, and
maybe because they are away from their hometowns, young women chatted with
me much more frequently than elsewhere (which is zero times everywhere,
except in Esfahan).  Zahra, for instance, wants my advice on whether she
should take the medical exam or the English language exam the day after.
Hard questions by confused young people!

<P>In the evening, a pleasant surprise awaits me at the pension.  Ali, an
Iraqi Kurd and the night receptionist, tells me the other receptionist
charged me an outrageous price, and that paying half as much will suffice.
So there are people without interest in short-term profits!  I chat a lot
with him and his friends, because it is of course impossible to think about
going to sleep in my bed now in the courtyard, where the students still
recite their lessons.

<P>I am extremely exhausted, and the sometimes extreme solicitude of
Iranians (partly due to the fact that I am a "Westerner", and thus a rare
animal) starts unnerving me a bit, especially now.  Iranians do not
understand that "Westerners" sometimes <I>want</I> to be alone, or have
trouble coping with large groups of people hanging all over them and
constantly talking to them from all angles.  Once the novelty of talking to
a foreigner fades away, the group will leave you alone, which unfortunately
also means that you are marked "available" for the next group...  After
going through the same ceremonial many times a day, and every day, things
become a bit repetitive.  But one cannot complain, as they are in their
country and culture, and we are the foreigners and should be tolerant of
local ways.  The most practical way to cope with what is sometimes
perceived as excessive solicitude (but of course only meant as hospitality)
is to spin a web of half-lies about other obligations, but I did not like
this approach.

<P>The next morning, after finishing the night in one of the rooms vacated
by the early departing students, Ali shows me around town.  When seeing
that Ali is a local, two Esfahani girls sidle up and ask us whether they
can join us.  Sure!  We visit Abambar-e Shesh Badgiri (a water-reservoir
with six wind-towers; such towers are the chief landmarks in Yazd), the
Masjed-e Jame mosque, and the narrow alleys of the mudbrick-built old town.
The girls are very interesting to talk to (especially that you rarely get
the opportunity to do so completely unsupervised), and are strongly in
favor of more rights for women.

<H3>Iranian Women</H3>

Iranian women, just like their Turkic and Arabic sisters, are extremely
beautiful (in my eyes), even though you often have to judge from their
faces only, as the supposedly Islamic dresscode severely restricts what can
be visible.  The excessive vigilance and zeal of the "komiteh" in the early
1980s seems to have become a thing of the past, judging from curls of hair
generously spilling out from the fringes of headscarves (especially of
young women), discreet make-up and perfume, more colorful, short, and
shape-revealing (two-piece) chadors rather than those long black "tents",
etc.  (And I did not even venture into the upperclass districts of any
city, where things are reputedly even more decadent!)  Many young women
looked straight into my eyes, smiled at me, swayed their hips when feeling
observed, and sometimes even chatted me up.  Unfortunately this always drew
large crowds of male passersby, and, although I then never overheard any
aggressive remarks or felt jealousy or threat, the girls then always lost
their courage.  Iranian boys told me they could nowadays get away with
dating girls and taking them to pastry stores, without anybody asking them
for a marriage license or a proof of being relatives [though one of them
later sent me a letter saying that this is being cracked down upon again,
and that he got arrested for precisely doing this].

<P>Iranian women have many more civil rights than their Gulf Arabic sisters
(funny, no, that the "West" always conveniently forgets this when
supporting these countries and despising Iran), and are active parts of
much of the public life, as nurses, teachers, MPs, etc.  They may actually
drive cars, even alone.  It was funny to see pedestrian-crossing signs that
were seemingly imported from Western Europe, because they depict a mother
in a rather short skirt crossing the street with her little son, rather
than a walking triangle with a son.  Also, long-legged, blonde, unveiled
Barbie-dolls were on sale, and I wondered how the importers could get away
with this.  [However, they seem to have been banned recently, with the
introduction of shorter, olive-skinned, and dark-haired dolls, which I
endorse, because "Western" imperialism should not dictate the canons of
beauty to other nations (and I see this in Turkey, where many
middle/upper-class women have their hair dyed blonde in a vain attempt to
look more desirable to their blonde-crazy men, although it often has the
opposite effect, on me), and that wear the chador and headscarves, which,
if a logical requirement for the current regime, makes me sad.]

<P>Indeed, other than the general mood being gloom (especially, but, I am
afraid, not uniquely because of this being "Moharram", the mourning month),
the most depressing thing during my stay in Iran was to see the women,
suffering in chadors and headscarves.  Yes, I know, what a grandiloquently
naive and ignorant statement this is, but bear with me and give me a
chance!  I went to Iran very open-minded about this, I have spent years
living and traveling in Muslim countries, I have discussed this for hours
with Muslim women, and I considered myself mentally prepared, but after ten
days, my resolve evaporated and slowly turned into anger.  I perceived this
as sheer oppression, I believed to sense suffering, especially among
younger (and thus more open-minded) women.  Seven-year-old girls and many
of the older women would not even arouse a prisoner on the deathrow.  I
cannot add anything to the debate that has not been said yet, and I know
all the pros from first-hand reports, but the cons far outweigh them
<I>if</I> this dresscode is <I>imposed</I> (by relatives or governments)!
Why do women have to pay the price for men's supposed inability to contain
themselves?  This is so unfair and hypocritical!  If Islam were a powerful
religion, then it would not have to defend its women against its men!
Anybody having seen chadored women spend half of their lives sweating like
hell under these dark tents and delegating one hand full-time to the
readjustment of the chador after every move, cannot be indifferent to the
plight of these women.  Even if you consider this assessment imperialist,
note that I have the right to express my own opinion.

<H2>12 - 13 July 1996: - Tabas - Mashhad</H2>

After Yazd, it is a long bus-haul north, straight through the desert, to
Mashhad.  As usual, the bus-ride is quite a cultural experience, and the
crew is particularly friendly on this one.  Halfway, at 10pm or so, we stop
in the Tabas oasis for a picnic under the palmtrees of a park near the bus
station.  This is where in 1979 the US rescue attempt for the hostages held
in Tehran failed after some of their helicopters crashed due to whirling up
too much sand when flying low over the desert...

<P>Mashhad-the-Holy turns into a quite harrowing, claustrophobic
experience.  Indeed, it is "Moharram", the mourning month, and the city is
packed with seemingly millions (though it feels more like billions) of
pilgrims who converge here to pay their respects at the tomb of Emam Reza,
one of the major martyrs of Shi'ite Islam.  The "savari" ride from the
bus-terminal to downtown, along Kheyabun-e Emam Reza, soon confirms this,
and I still do not understand how it was possible that I actually found a
place to stay (admittedly, the "room", if one can say so, was the most
disgusting one of my life, and I am not known for being picky about rooms).

<P>Near my "mosaferkhune", on Moghaddas square, the throng of pilgrims
fills half the boulevard:  they are almost exclusively men, clad in black,
and slowly shuffle forward to the Haram-e Motahhar-e Emam Reza, the holy
precinct with the shrine.  Drums are mournfully beaten, group leaders with
loudspeakers wail prayers echoed by the pilgrims, and every couple seconds
or so, synchronized with a single hollow drum beat, everybody flagellates
themselves.  No blood seems to be drawn from this, but it is ghostly enough
to make a lasting imprint on my mind.  It feels unbearable for me as a
non-believer, but this is a once-in-a-lifetime experience.  So, on the
sidewalks, from where women and individual pilgrims observe the organized
pilgrim groups on their procession, I work my way forward to the shrine as
well, dressed in my darkest gear, and with my hair combed flat so that I do
not stick out too much (I normally have a crew cut, and am blond).

<P>The circular precinct features some of the best Islamic architecture in
the world, with golden roofs visible from far away and with mind-bogglingly
sumptuous mosques and madrassas (Kur'an schools).  After a cursory
bodysearch and deposit of my daypack (no cameras of course, and even if it
were allowed, one would have to be ruthlessly disrespectful to shoot any
photos of these events), I am admitted into the precinct.  Some pilgrims
sidle up to me every now and then, asking me whether I am a Muslim.
Although I say `no', they are totally tolerant, maybe in the belief that my
very presence here will put me on the right path anyway?  There is so much
to see here that you cannot take it all in with just one visit.  Other than
the stunning tilework, the key experience is of course further observation
of the pilgrims.  Here is Shi'ite Islam in full action, and I am amazed
that I can, as an infidel, walk up all the way to the holy tomb itself:
the religious authorities are sometimes very tolerant, no matter what
prejudice circulates in the "West".  Once they have touched and kissed the
tomb of Reza, some pilgrims become hysteric:  adult men roll on the floor,
big tears flow down their cheeks, foam builds up on their mouths, they beat
themselves senseless, and are dragged away by their more sober friends,
while still wailing "ya Reza, ya Ali"...  Unforgettable sights, observed
from within, not through long lenses or on some documentary channel.  I
feel superfluous as an infidel, but, even though many would warn you that
such "fanatics" can easily turn into a raging mob at the slightest
provocation, I must also add that I feel very safe among all these
believers.

<P>I also explore other parts of Mashhad, sometimes just looking for a
peaceful rest on a park bench away from the sounds and bustle of the
pilgrims, at other times being magnetically drawn back to the "Haram".
Mashhad is famous for its saffron (I could have paid for my entire trip
with the profits I would have made by buying here and selling abroad; five
grams cost about $2.25).  The spice and dry food stores have other
interesting items on sale, namely "Mashhad pilgrimage kits", with a prayer
stone (made of clay from Mecca) (Shi'ites put their foreheads on such
stones when praying), a rosary (?), a cake of soap, and some other tacky
souvenirs, featuring portraits of the martyrs Reza or Ali.

<H3>Islam</H3>

Shi'ite Islam is the branch of Islam that is hugely predominant in Iran,
unlike in all other Muslim countries, where Sunni Islam is prevalent.
Although the aforementioned self-flagellation and other forms of
pain-infliction were hard to watch, I have not even seen the "worst" of it,
namely when piercing and drawing of blood is involved (that was a few weeks
before I arrived).  Shi'ites seem hugely obsessed with violence and
martyrdom, or is it just a way to cope with "the system"?  Compared to
(mostly Sunni) Turkey (for instance), Iran seems to have much fewer mosques
(or maybe the Turkish ones, supposedly often built with Iranian money, are
more visible due to their characteristic architecture?), the calls for
prayer are broadcast with much fewer decibels, and fewer women wear full
chadors (with actual veils, I mean) (compared to Eastern Turkey, in this
case).  Just like in Turkey, now, life just goes on during the prayer
times, as there is no visible rush to the nearest mosque, and very few
people actually pray out in the open.  Although Shi'ite Islam is the State
religion, other religions are tolerated and alive:  Zoroastrians, Armenian
Orthodox Christians, Protestants, Jews, Sunnis, etc, (seem to) have full
religious rights.  As conveyed above in the section on women, the
revolutionary guards ("komiteh") are slowly loosening their tight grip on
the supposedly Islamic dresscode, and have actually been merged into the
regular police.  All these details show how warped an image the "West" has
of Iran (and Turkey), as there are no "fanatic unshaved mobs praying most
of the time and building bombs otherwise".  What was new for me in Iran
compared to secular Turkey, is the omnipresence of "zakat" boxes on the
sidewalks ("zakat", as one of the five pillars of Islam, is the donation of
20% of your income to the needy), and the additional road-signs counting
down the number of kilometers to the nearest mosque.

<H2>14 July 1996: - Neishabur - Mashhad</H2>

Having spent the entire previous evening tracking down a florist with
roses, I head out to Neishabur, both to escape the claustrophobia of
Mashhad and to fulfill my self-imposed mission (ever since I read Amin
Maalouf's "Samarkand" about Omar Khayyam and his "Rubaiyat" quatrains).  It
is a short bus-ride west of Mashhad, and the town is very pleasant and
lively, contrary to the assessment in my Lonely Planet guidebook.
Neishabur was once one of the most learned cities in Iran, but today it
seems little more than a provincial town.  A taxi ride later, I am in a
cute, well-manicured park, and easily spot Khayyam's tomb, as it is domed
by a huge toppled wine-glass (what else?!).  By putting my red rose on his
tomb, I help fulfill his prediction that his tomb would always be covered
with rose petals (especially that the nearby rose-bush does not carry
flowers at this time of the year).  I had imagined this would be a very
intimate moment, and that the tomb would be hard to spot inside an actual
cemetery, but many dozens of people pay their respects to this gifted
mathematician and remarkable poet, and Neishabur honors its most famous son
with a tomb in a park.

<P>The "Rubaiyat" quatrains, such as the above, are full of irreverence for
the political and religious leaders; they mention courtship and wine, and
they remind us of the shortness and meaninglessness of life.  Not
surprisingly, these poems are not very popular with the current regime, but
many people seem to have stowed copies away, since I was often shown old
illustrated hardcover editions, so that I could read them during the night.
I linger for many hours in the park, enjoying the peace, before returning
for a last night to Mashhad.

<H2>15 July 1996: - Gonbad-e Kavus - Gorgan</H2>

Some of the Pakistani pilgrims at my "mosaferkhune" had told me that today
would be a very special day, called "ashoora", namely the day Emam Hossein
was martyred, and that this would be the culmination of the pilgrimage
season, but I had not expected anything like this.  At 7am, even the tiny
street from my "mosaferkhune" to Moghaddas Square (where Emam Khomeini
Boulevard crosses through on its way to the "Haram") is chock-a-block with
shoulder-to-shoulder rows of pilgrims, flagellating themselves more
viciously than ever.  I cannot even get out of the building, and my bus
leaves in half an hour!  Fortunately, my backpack is of a nice Islamic
green, so I do venture out, dodging the chains flying over the pilgrims'
shoulders, and slowly make it to Moghaddas Square.  It is even worse there,
but I have to cross to the other side of the huge boulevard in order to be
on the one lane remaining open for (outgoing) traffic, which is where I
hope to catch a taxi to the bus terminal.  At first, the police prevent me
from trying to cross, but then, when I show them my bus ticket, they have
sympathy for me and actually escort me across the boulevard.  Needless to
say that the taxi rank is empty, that every passing vehicle is crammed with
people, and that I cannot possibly run the remaining distance to the
terminal in the remaining time.  So I start walking, and the miracle
happens:  a taxi screeches to a halt in front of me, and all passengers
spill out.  Alhamdolellah!  I dive into it, gasp "terminal, lotfan!", and
make it onto my bus just in time.

<P>Mashhad was thus quite an experience, and I sigh with relief when my bus
pulls out of town on big suburban boulevards.  The plain is wide and
fertile, along a range of mountains with the Turkmen border.  When we pass
the crossing where a road forks off to Ashkhabad (the Turkmen capital), I
breathe deeply, as this is as close as I will get to closing the missing
link with my former Silk Road trip, which was unceremoniously ended in
Ashkhabad two years before, when I was denied an Iranian visa because the
border was closed to foreign nationals (see my
<A HREF="../uzbekistan.trip/">Uzbekistan</A> and
<A HREF="../turkmenistan.trip/">Turkmenistan</A> travelogues).
Shortly after, the powerful bus (I was very happy with Cooperative #15)
climbs into hilly steppe and eventually reaches a fabulously beautiful
large forest near Dasht.  The vision of green leaves soothes my soul after
all this gloom in Mashhad, but part of this depressive mood has peeled off
to me, because I have not been involved in any meaningful conversation for
days now.  The people are still friendly everywhere, but the language
barrier gets very high once you are off the Silk Road and the major cities,
so conversation boils down to basics in my Tarzan Farsi or their pidgin
English, and there is lots of staring to cope with (oh yes, the Asiatic
stare...).

<P>But, as usual when the morale is lowest, solutions pop up.  First, since
we are passing provinces with Turkmen populations, there are many Turkmen
passengers and crew on the bus, and, to their great delight, I can show off
my Turkish language skills.  Next, we reach the Dasht-e Gorgan plain near
the Caspian Sea, with its rice paddies, corn fields, etc:  another riot of
greenery.  This must be where they shot "Bashoo"?  My eyes scan the
horizon, and, yes, there it is, still some 30km away, the Gonbad-e Kavus in
the same-named town!  After unloading everybody at the terminal, the crew
actually gives me a VIP ride on the bus to this burial tower!  Built under
the Seldjuk Turks in the year 1006, this 55m high brick tower of a stark
beauty is incredibly well-preserved (it looks like water-towers built back
home in the 1950s) and has awesome radiance.  Its sheer age and size (maybe
the highest tower in the world at that time?)  testify to a timelessness
that makes one reckon that this secular building will still stand unscathed
when many of the younger Islamic buildings will need more serious repair.
Under the bemused eyes of superb Turkmen women in colorful silk dresses, I
take some photos of the tower and then stumble into an icecream parlor.

<P>There I meet Carole and Luc, a French couple touring Iran in their
private car.  Since they are also headed for Gorgan for the night, they
offer me a ride, which I gratefully accept, happy to have a full-scale
conversation again and to have somebody to share my experiences with, to
get feedback from, and to assess my trip so far.  In Gorgan we settle for a
hotel distinctly above my usual budget, but after the hell-hole of a room
in Mashhad I need a nice bed and shower.  I easily haggle the receptionist
down from the (legal) 300% charge for foreigners to a 120% charge of what
Iranians would pay.  What "moved" him was that I live in Turkey and draw a
Turkish salary, but he is still unbending to yield the remaining 20%:  "But
you are a foreigner nevertheless, and <I>must</I> pay more!"  I cannot see
the logic behind this, and it seems not entirely self-serving:  he seems to
genuinely believe that it is the only possible system that foreigners must
be overcharged.  Anyway...

<P>After a short siesta due to the long haul to here (the French couple
also left from Mashhad this morning), we leave for dinner just before
sunset, fully taking advantage of having a car.  There is only one thing to
do:  just follow all the other cars heading out of town and up the slope
into the forest on the mountains behind.  The road-sides form a huge picnic
and barbecue ground, and we have "shishlik" at an open-air restaurant.  The
people seem more relaxed and fun-loving here; maybe it is because of the
more colorful environment?  We get invitations to Tehran and other places
by nearby picnickers, and thus round off the day in harmony.

<H3>Media</H3>

Iranian media include three English-language dailies (Iran News, Tehran
Times, and Kayhan), which, for a few cents, will keep you informed about
the world happenings through numerous clippings from AP, AFP, DPA, or
whoever.  In addition, there is of course lots of government-line hype on
Iran herself, plus splendid entertainment, namely in the editorials!  I
typed in a few jewels, obviously crafted by master ideologues:

<H2>16 July 1996: - Ramsar</H2>

Still with the two French, and after fueling up for a mind-boggling $1.00
(yes, one dollar!), I ride west through the coastal strip.  It is difficult
to get to the azur-blue calm waters of the Caspian Sea, because the trunk
road is far in the hinterland and most of the shore seems occupied by the
villas of wealthy families or by hotels and garishly painted private
holiday resorts (of the army, of the ministries, etc).  Even the villages
and the modern drab concrete shoebox assemblies (a.k.a.  resort towns) near
the water seem to orient their bustle towards the main road rather than the
shore.  Public beach-life seems to be not quite politically correct, and
when, then it is behind sex-segregating curtains!  Everything looks
run-down, if not seemingly abandoned since 1979 when fun became illegal.
Chaluz and Nosaar, the much celebrated resorts with a direct road to Tehran
on the other side of the Alborz mountains, are pretty disappointing, so we
just have seafood lunch there.

<P>As the French head south to Tehran, I board a minibus further west to
Ramsar, the most-sung of the resorts because the coastal strip is narrowest
there and the forest almost plunges from the mountains into the sea.  Of
course, the Shah had a villa there, which is now the "Museum of Decadence"
(what else?!).  The driver drops me off at a nice "mosaferkhune" where a
charming old man immediately quotes the right price, for once dispensing me
from having to haggle.  (This actually becomes a constant feature from now
on, maybe because I am way off the beaten tourist track, or because my
Farsi is getting better?)  I stroll up and down this pleasant village,
taking in the sweet smell of the forest and the flowers, relaxing here and
there, observing the locals taking it easy as well, and finally having a
dinner that is so far the best one, by a landslide.  (This also becomes a
feature from now on, is it just luck or is it experience?)

<H3>Iranians and Iran</H3>

Warning:  my following impressions about the general mood of Iranians are
most probably based on a "bad" sampling, namely those who wanted to get in
touch with me (i.e., a foreigner) and those who somehow wound up on my
trail (i.e., bus-drivers, grocers, receptionists, etc).  The impressions
were not only gathered by conversations in English, because my pidgin Farsi
(plus Turkish) plus sign-language can go a long way towards
conveying/understanding what is being meant.  Anyway, here's the bottom
line:  almost everybody (I met) seemed to consider Iran a prison or hell,
and outside of Iran as liberty and paradise.  Sure, the leaders and the
media, including the English-language ones, put up a nice show of pretense
and self-congratulation as to the achievements of the Islamic Revolution,
but the man on the street acted differently and told me something else.
They want more freedoms [remember:  this trip was pre-Khatami!], they
complain about high and ever-rising prices, they have to queue up for some
basic food items, buses are searched at road-blocks every 50km or so, etc.
Hardly the signs of a successful upheaval...  The foreign traveler is
bombarded day in day out with the same questions by seemingly thousands of
men:  how can we get a visa for your country and a job there?  how much do
you earn in your country?  tell us about the morals in your country!  how
many girl-friends do you have?  (admission to less than seven simultaneous
relationships usually meets with condescending smiles) do you have erotic
magazines in your backpack?  (who would risk his hard-won visa by smuggling
such hot goods into Iran?)  etc.  I spent a lot of time explaining to them
that the mention of my salary is meaningless unless they also know how much
a loaf of bread costs back home, that the "West" has huge unemployment
rates so that they would only be employed if they have quite unique
qualifications, that the "West" has huge crime rates (unlike Iran), that
friendship and family have decreasing roles in the "West" so that they most
probably would hate it there every minute, etc, but they were all oblivious
to such rhetoric:  they just wanted to get out...

<H2>17 July 1996: - Rasht - Masuleh - Rasht</H2>

Leaving the coastline, I head south to Rasht, where I find a surprisingly
quiet "mosaferkhune" right off the main square.  After a short stroll
through town, I start working my way to Masuleh, by public transportation,
i.e.  by "savari" with a change in Fuman at mid-distance.  Not such a great
idea, it turns out, because I'm stuck in Fuman for two hours, as there is
no outgoing traffic around noon.  After a failed attempt at hitchhiking, I
see a "savari" driver motion to me that he will leave "any time soon".
Well, that includes getting the engine started some thirty minutes later,
and then spending a full hour slowly looping three times through the
village, with a blaring honk to drum up more business.  I once suffered
through such an ordeal in the sweltering heat of a Guatemalan jungle
village, until the minibus was thrice overfilled, but fortunately Iranians
have a lower threshold of discomfort, so we get started when the minibus is
but filled twice.  On we go, at bicycle speed, dropping a peasant here and
picking one up there, literally every 500m.  The ride is through stunningly
beautiful green farmland scenery, where women work in colorful dresses
without chador, and eventually we do reach the 1,000m high village of
Masuleh, at the end of the asphalted road, in the middle of a pleasant
forest and pastures.

<P>Masuleh is well-known for its distinctive architecture:  the village is
laid out like a staircase, on a mountain-slope.  When you stroll past a row
of houses, you are actually walking over somebody's roof!  An intricate net
of staircases connects the various "floors", and all the features of a
village are built in, such as a market square, a mosque, etc.  Very
interesting.  But also a bit geared towards tourism, not necessarily for
foreigners, but mostly for Tehrani and Rashti sightseers:  women sell
woollen handicraft, such as socks, caps, dolls, etc.

<P>Enter Mahmut.  He is a young man about my age, and enthusiastically
waves me into the next "chaykhune" for a few rounds of tea.  Not much
English spoken here, about as much as my budding Farsi, but his warm
hospitality and my dictionary provide for an entertaining few hours.  For a
better view of his village, he proposes to guide me on a walk along the
slope of the opposing mountain, which we do.  At some pasture, we join a
few old men, and a Tehrani architect, over a few more teas, relaxing,
chatting, taking in the beauty and peace of the surroundings.  Mahmut is
quite adamant that this fairy place is a paradise, but he also complains
about tourists dropping candy wrappings and plastic bottles.  Yes, how can
one walk through such pristine nature and yet feel nothing about spoiling
it by dropping such items?  In the early evening, we complete our loop and
make it back to the "savari" terminal.  There would have been plenty of
possibilities for homestays overnight here, but I did not know this and
thus head back to my pension (and luggage) in Rasht.

<H3>Dangers and Annoyances</H3>

"Western" prejudice has it that Iran is a very dangerous place, but I am
happy to disappoint my readers:  I did not spot any sources of danger,
other than being overwhelmed by the beauty of the country and the
hospitality of its people!  From a "Western" viewpoint, there are a few
annoyances though.  Much to the embarrassment of the majority, some
Iranians (including the government) are learning how to make money off
foreign visitors, especially the accursed taxi-drivers, of course.  Also,
every foreigner is still a scarce commodity, so one ought to be prepared to
be intensely stared at (making one feel like a space alien) and to be
accosted innumerable times for the same standard twenty-point-dialogue,
with much plucking of one's forearms to catch your attention or mark a
point (I became very worried I would return home without skin on my arms).
But one soon learns how to cope with such excessive solicitude, and it is
really irrelevant compared to what is being positively experienced.

<H2>18 July 1996: - Ghazvin</H2>

Through glorious forest scenery, past a majestic dam, and eventually onto
the high plateau with steppe, I progress south-west to Ghazvin.  This is a
very pleasant, small, and clean town, a far cry from the scenes of hell
described by James Clavell in his (1979) "Whirlwind" historic fiction.  In
general, both here and elsewhere, looking into the eyes of those older than
30, say, I find it hard to believe that some of these men and women
committed the excesses of 1979...  Anyway, this is here and now.

<P>I spot a nice hotel right off the main square, and they charge 7,000
Rials (no zeroes missing) for a kind of room that I saw elsewhere often
quoted for 60,000 Rials, and without even making a difference between
locals and foreigners.  The friendly receptionist seems very resourceful,
so I approach him with my wish to visit Alamut, the nearby but
hard-to-reach fortress of the Assassins.  After some bargaining, he sets to
his task and delivers:  tomorrow morning, an acquaintance will take me
there, in his four-wheel-drive!  (I do not wish to embarrass those readers
who have also done this by mentioning the price that I eventually paid for
this excursion.)

<P>I make friends with some of the Iranian Azaris staying at the hotel, and
they call me for tea, which they prepare on a gas-cooker in their room!
Otherwise, I while away the rest of the day by strolling through town,
writing postcards (the first ones I find since Shiraz, and they are about
Esfahan), etc.  I simply must mention the place I had dinner at, namely
"Eghbali Restaurant" (on the main street), where you have to sample their
absolutely divine "khoresht", which will set you back, with all the
trappings, by about $2 (no zeroes missing).

<H2>19 July 1996: - Alamut - Ghazvin</H2>

At the appointed 8am, there is of course no jeep and no driver, and
everybody is still sleeping fast.  After rousing the receptionist from his
slumber, things slowly swing into action, and finally, at 10am, the driver
materializes.  The receptionist suddenly decides to join, having never been
to Alamut, and we then pick up the driver's son and a picnic basket
prepared by his wife.

<P>The 90km road first goes through a plain, and then climbs a succession
of two steep passes, to the village called Alamut (no relation to the main
castle, though, which is still beyond).  This stretch of the road seems to
be the Mecca of Iranian cyclists, and my legs itch with jealousy as we pass
them.  Soon after, the asphalt turns into a dirt-road, and I can better
visualize the descriptions of fearless Dame Freya Stark, who traveled here
earlier this century.  It also dawns on me that none of my three companions
has ever been to Alamut, as they have no clue where to drive next and start
asking every peasant, proceeding by binary search before locating the right
turn-off.  Here the track becomes extremely steep, and I am surprised that
even a jeep can negotiate this slope.  Eventually, we cross another
village, whose sewage consists of a minor torrent simply diverted through
the main streets.  To my astonishment, some brandnew cars are parked here,
and I look in vain for the helicopter platform where they must have come
from.

<P>Behind this hamlet is a huge vertical outcrop of a rock, on top of which
used to stand the main castle of the Assassins.  This is where the
Ismailis, a 12th century heretic Shi'a sect, led by Hassan Sabah (a.k.a.
the old man of the mountains), had their main hideaway.  All over the
Middle East, they were much feared for a century and a half because of the
political assassinations that their fanatical followers would stage in
public, in return for a promise of paradise, with 72 ever-virgin female
servants ("houris") and other trappings.  There is controversy over the
real name of the sect, but it is a fact that it was adapted by the
Crusaders in order to designate murderers (hence the French and English
word "assassin").  To everybody's big relief, the Mongols managed to
achieve where they had all failed so far, namely in capturing this
well-defended stronghold.  Actually, they literally did not leave a stone
on top of the other one, so there is not much to see here.  But it is
getting here and being here that I came for, and I feel very elated to
stand at a place that so much influenced History.  (See, e.g., Maalouf's
"Samarkand" for more on the Assassins.)  A quite slippery trail leads from
the parking lot around the rock and eventually onto it:  it is dizzyingly
high and one can imagine how easy it was to defend it.

<P>After taking in the place and picnicking there, we start the long 4hr
return journey, interrupted only by a tea-stop somewhere.  Of course, I
head back to Eghbali's for dinner.

<H2>20 July 1996: - Tabriz</H2>

Out at 7:30am, as recommended by everybody, I stand at the Tehran - Tabriz
road, where it goes through Ghazvin, in order to flag down a bus west to
Tabriz.  Every company at the bus terminal had refused to sell tickets to
Tabriz, saying it was easy to flag down a bus.  Easier said than done,
especially in the choking fumes of this polluted highway!  Moreover, the
first buses to Tabriz only come around 9am, and they are all full!  Every
bus would then slowly whiz by the waiting crowd, with a steward shouting
out the destination and the number of available seats, which of course puts
a foreigner at a big disadvantage, especially when he has a backpack to
haul around in the by now sweltering heat.  After getting my bearings in
this cut-throat competition for seats, I miraculously manage to secure one
in the middle of the last row on some bus.  This of course puts me into the
center of everybody's attention, be it for being offered conversation,
food, or drinks, or for being asked to read my (guide-)books, solve my
crossword puzzles, listen to my walkman, etc.  They are all very friendly,
and my Turkish takes me very long ways with all these Azaris (we are now in
the West Azarbayjan province) and even with the two Syrians, who say they
are from an area where everybody speaks Turkish as their native tongue (I
did not know Syria had a Turkish minority).  However, eventually, their
solicitous frenzy becomes a bit discomforting, and I wait for the bus to
arrive in Tabriz.

<P>Once there, after settling onward bus ticket and local accommodation
issues, I start strolling through town, but without much energy or gusto
for sightseeing proper.  It is a pleasant city, boasting even a pedestrian
shopping zone and finally some tape stalls with blaring rhythmic music, and
people watching here is as entertaining as ever.  So I just buy a newspaper
and head for some shade in some park.  Now, it does not happen often to a
Luxembourger to be abroad and suddenly see the name of a fellow countryman
on the front pages of every newspaper.  So imagine my delight when I see
the following headline:

<P>
<CENTER>
	  (Iran News, 20 July 1996, Vol. II, No. 503, Pg. 1)
<BR>		   <B>Santer Threatens EU Retaliation
		      Against U.S. Anti-Iran Law</B>
</CENTER>

<P>(Note to the ignorant:  Jacques Santer then was the current President of
the European Commission, and was Luxembourg's Prime Minister before picking
up that new post.)  Too bad I did not have a copy of such a newspaper with
me at each of my four rejected visa applications at Iranian embassies in
the last two years:  now that I have one, I am sure my next visa
application for Iran will go through in a breeze!  I feel like telling
every passerby that I am from the same country as this gentleman on the
photos who defies the USA and takes a pro-Iranian stand...

<H2>21 July 1996: Exit at the Iran/Turkey border</H2>

A seemingly interminable 4hr bus-ride takes me in the morning further west,
to Maku, the last Iranian town.  There, I join up efforts with Said and
Ibrahim, two Tabrizi businessmen bound for istanbul.  By "savari", we cover
the last few "farsakhs" to Bazargan, the border post.  The Iranian
authorities are again incredibly slow:  it takes them 2 hours to process
the twenty or so people in front of us, whereas on the Turkish side it is a
matter of one minute.  Catherine and John, an Australian couple on the Asia
overland trail, soon also make it across, and the Turkish customs officer
cheers at her when she rips away her chador before presenting her papers.
Half an hour later, by "dolmush" (collective taxi), we arrive in
DoGubeyazit, and head almost straight to the first place where we can enjoy
a much longed-for cool beer!  Before heading home to Ankara, I spend one
day here in DoGubeyazit, which features after all the gorgeous Ishak Pasha
palace found on so many posters of Turkey, and one day in Erzurum (300km or
5 hours west), which features some fine Seldjuk architecture.

<H2>Epilogue</H2>

The reader is of course right in noticing that my exit from Iran was quite
unceremonious and rushed, as if indeed escaping from a prison, although I
had myself preached to Iranians that Iran was not all that bad.  I must
confess that I was quite happy to finally be "out of there", to be
somewhere where fun was legal, etc, and even economically depressed eastern
Turkey looked like paradise at that moment.  I was happy to have done the
trip, that it went so smoothly, that I experienced so many wonderful things
that most people would not imagine exist in Iran, etc, but I needed to get
out of some of its gloom.  A few weeks later, once cozy at home, pouring
over my photos, telling my stories to my friends, receiving the first
letters from Iran, etc, I slowly fully realized what a fabulous trip it
was, that I already started missing Iran, that I actually wanted to go
back!

<P>I thank you, dear reader, for staying with me until this last line.
