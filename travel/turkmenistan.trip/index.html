<H2>Introduction</H2>

This is a report of a solo-trip to Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, undertaken
during July/August 1994.

<P>I have compiled this from my travel notes, often omitting irrelevant
details such as where I ate what, where I was sick with what, and so on,
but adding some afterthoughts and hindsight.

<P>This journey was totally improvised, reservations - except for flights
being a concept totally alien to me.  Of course I did some homework
beforehand, so as to know the must-sees.  Valuable information sources were
the Cadogan guide "Central Asia:  The Practical Handbook" (UK, 1993, by
Giles Whittell:  excellent value), the Lonely Planet guide "USSR - A Travel
Survival Kit" (Australia, 1991, by John Noble and John King:  a great book,
but it unfortunately came out as the Soviet Union was collapsing, and was
thus aging badly), and the "Blue Guide to the USSR" (an excellent source of
background knowledge).  Descriptions are kept informative enough so that
those who have been there should recognize the places, while those who
would like to go there should be able to locate them.  This report is not
intended to be a crash course on Central Asian history.

<P>This journey was on a shoestring budget, a mattress to crash on and a
shower being all that is needed when constantly on the move.  Round-trip
flights, visas, inoculations, medicine, and souvenirs excluded, I had a
daily maintenance ratio of about $12, covering accommodation, food, drinks,
transportation, and entrance fees.  This has to be relativized though, as
Uzbekistan was significantly more "expensive" than Turkmenistan.

<P>All views expressed here are mine, and you are the judge whether they
are witty insights, total misunderstandings, or unspeakable truths.

<P>Comments are welcome.

<P>Enjoy,<BR>

<H1>Part II: TURKMENISTAN</H1>

The Turkmens don't even bother to stop the bus at their  side  (I
guess  not many foreigners ever cross here), so I unceremoniously
enter the 26th country in my life.

<P>The bus-station in Tashauz is absolute bedlam, and I don't know yet that
I'm going to spend two of the most frustrating days of my life.  After
interviewing six locals or so (you have to abide by the Law of Big Numbers
here), the bottom-line, including outright contradictions, seems to be that
there are no buses to Ashkhabad.  Some say there is not even a road, others
pretend there never has been such a service, others say it is demanddriven
(and little demand in the dead of the summer), others want to ferry me in
whatever vehicle some of their acquaintances have, quoting prices for which
I could actually buy the entire vehicle.  I could try my luck in nearby
Kunya Urgench, but why should there be a difference, because Tashauz is big
enough by itself?

<P>The consensus seems to be that I should try my luck at the railway
station and get a ticket for the daily 8pm passage of the Moscow to
Ashkhabad train.  It's a 24hr haul, but I would still vastly prefer
sticking it out for 8hrs in a bus across the desert, just for the heck of
it, especially that I don't know how the then necessary re-entrance into
Uzbekistan would be handled.  Anyway, so on to the railway station.
Underway I ask as many people as are willing, or able, to answer:
apparently tickets are only on sale after 7pm, so I have about seven hours
to investigate alternatives.

<P>The first idea is of course to check out the airport, although half the
people tell me that these domestic flights have been discontinued a few
months ago.  All my new interviewees add an interesting melange of new
opinions as to the bus question.  Anyway, after a torrid ride in an
over-packed city-bus, I find out that there <I>are</I> flights, every two
hours or so, to Ashkhabad!  I drop my passport at the standby queue of
passports, although I'm a little reluctant to leave mine within easy reach
of just about anybody.  But this turns out unjustified, as the waiting
crowd is scrupulously honest and always shows me where my passport is in
the queue when I drop by to inspect how fast it is moving.  Most people
having reservations, it seems that the standby queue is not moving at all.
But time doesn't matter here, some people apparently wait since yesterday!

<P>As I wander around, asking questions as to the price of the ticket and
about my other alternatives, I collect even more contradictions, and find
out that the locals pay $1 (or was it $6?)  for the flight, whereas I would
have to pay a whopping $67.

<P>After a few hours of waiting, I decide to discard the train option,
especially that I have no clue how expensive my then necessary re-entrance
into Uzbekistan would be, and even to sacrifice the $67 so as to get the
hell out of this nightmare.  So I seek out various important looking people
of the airport staff and convey to them that I absolutely need to be on the
next flight out, no matter how many people are in front of me in the
standby queue.  They all promise, although my "need" is only based on my
wanting to have more time to explore Iran, but nobody delivers, despite my
amateurish attempts of bribing them (I have little experience in this
field).

<P>Various Turkmens offer to sell me their tickets (which means they would
have to enter the day-long standby queue, but I have come to believe that
queuing is a national pastime here), even at quite realistic prices, but
when I see that entering the waiting hall involves passport checks, I
wonder how a ticket for Ali Osman would match with my passport and looks.
Again, as an afterthought, I could have tried to bribe my way through that
obstacle, but I was in a near state of panic and couldn't think rationally
most of the time.

<P>Then I make friends with Murat, a Turkmen student from YIldIz
Universitesi in istanbul.  He also tries to help me, but in vain.  However,
in passing, he mentions that about thirty people left at 8am in the morning
on a bus to Ashkhabad, for about the same fare as the flight!  "Harika," I
think, back to my old plan.  When I move to the standby queue to retrieve
my passport, I see an obviously upper-class woman enter the airport with
her kids, stoop in front of the long standby queue, and then energetically
walk towards some office.  Minutes later, she emerges with a handwritten
notice, elbows her way across the queue, shoves the notice to the ticket
lady, and gets tickets.  Cool, what she can do, I can do!  Murat reads the
Cyrillic sign for me and says it's the airport commander's office.  OK, in
I go and tell him that since I have to pay for eleven (or sixty-seven?)
seats anyway, Turkmenistan Airlines had better treat me as a VIP passenger
and get me on the next flight out.  (I guess my ticket is
"reverse-subsidized," by which I mean that I reimburse the Turkmen
government for subsidizing tickets for Turkmens.)  "Sure," he says very
sympathetically, "come back half an hour before the next flight, and we'll
swing that deal."  Needless to say that he never shows up, leaving the
second-in-command behind, who is a rude obnoxious jerk and doesn't honor
his chief's promise.

<P>I definitely switch back to my bus plan now, retrieve my passport from
the queue at about 9pm (the last flight being gone, they are closing
anyway, so the queue will start all over again tomorrow morning), and walk
over to the motel in front of the airport.  Judging from the old Russian
receptionist's reaction, I must have been the first foreigner to check in
there, especially that the price list is not two-tiered.  She asks me
whether I have local currency.  "Da" (as I did some black market deals at
the airport).  I think this is going to be for all eternity the cheapest
accommodation I ever had to pay for:  the for Turkmens cut-throat rate is a
stunning $0.15!  However, the Soviet craze for bureaucracy makes that all
sixteen guests are crammed into four rooms:  the receptionist lady is
selling beds, not rooms, as I realize upon entering "my" room and finding
three people already in there.  I don't want to create a warped impression
of foreigners and their spending power, so, despite my desperate need for
privacy after this harrowing day, I don't go back to the reception in order
to rent an entire room for myself for a mindboggling $0.60.  My room
companions actually turn out to be extremely jovial and hospitable people,
and they invite me to share the dinner they are preparing in the room.  And
the Turkmen language being a lot closer to Turkish than Uzbek, I actually
round off the day in a good mood, especially that I now feel confident
about reaching Ashkhabad tomorrow, by bus!

<H2>Wednesday 10 August 1994: Tashauz - Ashkhabad</H2>

Back at the airport at 7am, I ask literally every sweeper, porter, and
taxi-driver where and when the bus to Ashkhabad is going to leave.  Believe
it or not, the answers oscillate between the non-existence of such a bus
and that it departs at 8pm!  In either case, it's a flagrant contradiction
with the 8am I was told.  Either these people spend their entire days
working at the airport without realizing what's going on around them, or,
in typical oriental fashion, making up a wrong answer is deemed more polite
than admitting not knowing the answer at all.  Information is extremely
hard to come by here, as the last 24 hours have proven, and I have to
exercise some self-control not to explode.

<P>At 9am, with still no bus in sight, I lose my nerve, storm back into the
airport commander's office (he is actually there now), get a (free!)
handwritten notice from him, shovel my way through the already long standby
queue, purchase a "VIP" ticket, and check in on the next flight.  Boarding
is the expected fun, due to a complete lack of discipline and the absence
of seating assignments:  everybody is holding seats for some cousin, who is
actually holding a seat for them in the other half of the cabin.  The
stewardesses give no safety instructions as we roll to the runway, and I am
the only one to fasten his seat-belt.  It's a no-frills flight (just a
glass of water), and as far as I am concerned, we could just as well have
flown over the moon, the desert being indeed a most desolate place.

<P>Unboarding and checking out in Ashkhabad is a matter of a few minutes,
this being a domestic flight.  It then takes me a long time to haggle a
taxi-driver down to a still shameful $4 so that he drive me around until I
have found a place to stay.  Ashkhabad is very widespread, and one of the
hottest towns on Earth.  My first attempt is at Hotel Jubilienaya
(two-star), which is, at $10, the cheapest place in town according to my
October 1993 guidebook.  The only alternative is the Intourist joint Hotel
Ashkhabad (also two-star), which is already known to be one of the biggest
rip-offs this side of the universe.  The taxi-driver eyes me and my
backpack suspiciously as I motion him to the former hotel, and I'm soon to
find out why:  over the last few months, the management has single-handedly
multiplied their price for foreigners by twelve!  "What?!"  I croak, "You
said $120?  Dollars?"  The receptionist actually manages to say yes without
blushing.  This is nothing else but twice the average <I>yearly</I> income
of Turkmens!  I'd die to see the reaction of a Turkmen/Uzbek in my country
when the receptionist says that, s/he not being a citizen of the European
Union, s/he would have to pay $60,000 for a night, in a two-star hotel!  My
reaction is probably equally priceless, because I am literally fighting for
air.  Some countries are obviously not ready yet for individual journeyers,
because they are geared up only for embassy personnel (this hotel actually
houses the US and German embassies) and foreign business-people on expense
accounts, and for package tourists, who all don't mind being ripped off, or
don't know that they are being robbed blind.

<P>Bargaining being predictably useless, and asking at the Intourist joint
being a predictable waste of time, I appeal to the resourcefulness of my
taxi-driver (one of the rare opportunities where I appreciate a cabbie),
and ask him to get me to the cheapest place in town, no matter where, no
matter what kind of place it is.  And I land in the funniest place I've
ever slept for a fee!

<P>About 1km south of the Tikinsky Bazaar, he drops me at what turns out to
be a private mental hospital, or so!  A bunch of harmless fools are living
there in a commune, and a woman drops by in the mornings to look after
them.  They have a spare room with mattresses on the ground, and rent them
out for $3 a night; I didn't figure out whose initiative that was.  I share
the room with some very friendly Iranians and Pakistanis, and they assure
me that this is indeed the cheapest place in town.  And arguably the
coziest one, as the atmosphere is excellent.  You may use all the
facilities (fridge, cooking machine, hamam, TV, even A/C, ...), and I
simply must recommend this haven of peace:  the address is 106, ulitsa
Shaumyana (just go south of the street going past Tikinsky Bazaar and the
long-distance bus-station; every taxidriver seems to know it).

<P>After the welcome tea, I take a shower, shave, and dress up as well as I
can, because I need to go to the Iranian Embassy.  But some background
first:  my project is to do the second half of the southern branch of the
Silk Road, from Tashkent to istanbul, across Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan,
Iran, and Turkey.  I had bribed ($15) my way into an Intourist-independent
two-week-visa to Uzbekistan ($50), bought a tourist visa ($30) from the
friendly Turkmen consul in Ankara, and don't need any visa for Turkey.  My
first tourist-visa application for Iran had been rejected, without any
motive, just like all other applications this summer from Turkey,
indiscriminately of the nationalities of the applicants.  On the
sympathetic Iranian consul's suggestion (after I personally appealed to him
and described him my project, which would have to be changed without the
help of Tehran), I wrote an emotional appeal to the Tehran authorities, and
he added a personal letter of recommendation, but we didn't have an answer
when I left for Uzbekistan.  But he said he'd telex the answer to
Ashkhabad, in case it is positive.  In any case, he said, Iranian consuls
have the right to deliver transit visas to European Union citizens, on the
spot, without consulting with Tehran first.  Clarification:  transit-visas
must be obtained from the embassy of the starting country of the transit
(Turkmenistan, in my case), so he couldn't write me one in advance.  He
also solemnly assured me, just like his Turkmen colleague, that the border
from Ashkhabad to Mashhad was no longer closed to foreigners, as otherwise
I wouldn't even have embarked on this project.  Iranian transit visas being
known to be sort-of easy to extend once in Iran, I left Ankara in complete
confidence about the feasibility of my itinerary.

<P>At the Iranian Embassy in Ashkhabad, things start out funnily.  A clerk
rips off a page from a calendar and asks me to write my request on it, or
wherever there is free space on it, so that he carry it over to the consul.
So I identify myself, and ask about my tourist visa, mentioning that my
application was filed from Ankara.  Minutes later, the slip of paper comes
back:  "I'm sorry, I cannot give you a tourist visa."  Guessing that my
second application was rejected, despite the glorious prose of my appeal
and despite the letter of recommendation from the Ankara consul, I ask for
another calendar page and apply for a transit visa towards Turkey, not
without adding my business card and signing as Prof.  Dr.  Pierre Flener.
Minutes later:  "I'm sorry, I cannot give you a transit visa either."  The
business card doesn't come back, though.  On the next calendar page, I ask:
"Why?", signing Prof.  Dr.  Pierre Flener again.  Sensing the ridicule in
his way of dealing with me, the consul finally comes out to see me, and
explains that the land-border is still closed to non-CIS citizens and
non-Iranians.  Once again, the misinformation syndrome has struck, and I
cannot even challenge him on that, because he's definitely the authority
here, not his distant colleagues in Ankara:  the right paper is more
important here than the promise or the person.  Pleading turns out useless,
because he is about as friendly and cooperative as a prison door, and even
if I flew to Tehran (at a cost that would have exhausted my cash
travelbudget, credit cards and traveler checks being yet unknown in
Turkmenistan), he would only grant me a transit visa of three days, which
could be shorter than the bureaucratic hassle needed to extend the visa
once in Tehran.  (Later, back in Ankara, the Iranian consul told me that my
second application had actually been accepted, but under the proviso that I
go on a package tour, which is very expensive of course.  I didn't have the
guts yet to investigate whether that border is <I>really</I> closed for me
or not.)  He even dares suggest I apply again for a tourist visa, and wait
in Ashkhabad for 4-6 weeks until the answer comes in!  A strange sense of
humor, or no notion of time?  I briefly curse the fact that I wanted to do
this trip within five weeks only, because otherwise I'd have more time to
patiently seek for solutions to the obstacles that are being thrown into my
path.  Having first assured myself that he sees "absolutely no solution"
(I'm thinking of baksheesh of course), I leave the embassy.

<P>After overcoming my deep disappointment, I look at the map and see
myself truthfully trapped:  no return to Uzbekistan (visa too difficult to
obtain); nothing else really worth to see in Turkmenistan; civil wars in
Tajikistan, Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Afghanistan; and a flight to Pakistan
(Islamabad or Karachi, where Iranian transit-visas are definitely easy to
obtain) would also deplete my cash reserves.  I very briefly contemplate
the option of setting out to the Iranian border and see what improvisation
is possible there, but then I reject this idea as foolhardy.  So I scrape
together what money I have and grudgingly buy a ticket ($422 for
foreigners!)  at the Aeroflot office (they haven't changed the sign to
Turkmenistan Airlines yet) for the next flight to istanbul, aborting my
trip and deciding to do the Iranian leg another year.  I'm of course angry
now for not having fully used my fifteen days in Uzbekistan, as I could
have stayed there for another three days and gone with Elena and Yulya to
the mountains in the east.

<P>At the Aeroflot office, I have a nice chat with a Turkmen lady who tells
me a lot of interesting things about her country.  She will be on the same
flight as I on Friday.  Then I stroll through Ashkhabad, which is a Soviet
reconstruction similar to Tashkent, as it was completely leveled by an
earthquake in 1948.  No historical buildings are left to see, but the
spacious shaded parks and tree-lined boulevards reward an afternoon of
exploration.  Surprisingly, in one park, I find a still untoppled statue of
Lenin, set on a magnificently tiled pedestal depicting the motives of
Turkmen rugs.  The two city bazaars, though set in ugly concrete
constructions, provide the usual riot of colors and smells.  I see some
nomad Turkmens who wear the typical huge suffocating shaggy sheepskin-hats.
I had somewhat hurriedly converted $10 into Turkmen Manat in Tashauz
yesterday, and it turns out that I will not be able to spend them all,
unless I indulge in imported goods:  my host "fools" want dollars, and
everything else is absurdly cheap.  So I decide to sample just about every
food and drink I can find in the streets and markets.

<P>But let me also tell you about my "fools."  The most jovial one is an
Azeri with large gold-plated teeth, who always talks in a funny, expansive
singsong manner.  He is the cashier as far as the $3/night are concerned.
Then there is the "pigeon," a man who constantly tends to (and talks to)
the many pigeons in the interior courtyard, and who has been seen in the
early mornings flapping his arms like wings.  The "radio" is a man who
speaks to himself all the time.  Another noteworthy one is the Iranian Kurd
who thinks I am Turkish and every now and then lectures me on the
atrocities committed by "my" government against the Kurds in Turkey.  The
others always shoo him away when he does this.  They are all completely
peaceful and harmless, pursuing their daily lives in a fixed pattern.

<P>The other guests are all Iranians or Pakistanis.  One of the latter is
traveling from Moscow to Karachi, but can't get into Iran either.  The
Iranians are here either on small business (aren't they always?), or, as
they say, "on holidays."  There being little to see here, I suspect they
also like the concept of freely available alcohol.  In the evening, we
picnic together in the courtyard on the wooden dais, and it's very amusing.
The Iranians are very embarrassed that I can't get into their country, but
they give me their addresses so that I contact them next time, because they
would then invite me from inside Iran.

<H2>Thursday 11 August 1994: Ashkhabad</H2>

I have another 36 hours to try and spend $5 in Manat on food and drinks.  I
idle around the parks and bazaars, and have a look at the excellent History
Museum ($1) with its fabled collection of ivory rhytons (drinking horns of
Zoroastrianism) and nice displays of nomad handicraft.  Other, supposedly
lesser museums, also charge foreigners $1, so I give them a pass.  I run
into people I met at the Tashauz airport, and spend the evening again with
the Iranians, Pakistanis, and our "fools."

<H2>Friday 12 August 1994: Ashkhabad - istanbul - Ankara</H2>

The flight to istanbul starts from the brand-new super-modern terminal
(built with Turkish expertise), and all goes smoothly until four passengers
can't get seats:  undetected over-booking!  First they let us swelter for
about an hour in an un-airconditioned cabin, checking the tickets one by
one.  Even the glass of water we obtain is not enough, and the general mood
is inversely proportional to the punishing sunshine outside.  Eventually,
they ferry us back to the terminal, for another check, and three hours
later back to the aircraft for a third check.  I have more chats with the
friendly Turkmen lady of yesterday.  But I can't believe that they never
over-booked before, or don't know how to handle this (definitely not in
this amateurish way), so I make sure I'm not among the last four to board,
as I suspect them to bump these unlucky passengers.  Everybody else has the
same suspicion, and I don't describe you the mess.  I am confident though,
because I told an English-speaking stewardess that with my $422 ticket I
had better not be bumped!  Finally we get off, and I sit next to two
Turkish engineers who had been involved in the construction of the new
terminal.  They couldn't go home for six months, and can barely wait for
their upcoming feast on iskender kebap and baklava.  So am I!  In istanbul,
I manage to get a connecting flight to Ankara.

<H2>Conclusion</H2>

Despite the sometimes discouraging effect of the mentioned difficulties and
frustrations of unorganized travel in Central Asia, I highly recommend such
a journey.  I am also confident that by the time other people get there,
some of my hurdles will have been cleared away.  Visa problems can now be
solved via Raisa or by bribes; linguistic problems must be solved
<I>before</I> going there (learn minimal Russian and/or Turkish:  I
couldn't stress this enough, as virtually nobody speaks western languages
(yet)); financial problems should disappear as soon as there is competition
(Raisa's B&B chain makes things sort-of affordable, but she will have to
lower her prices as soon as somebody competes with her), though I ignore
how much longer the two-tiered price-lists with multipliers of up to a
hundred will be maintained at hotels, museums, and domestic flights.

<P>Everything is sensationally beautiful and exotic, and I look forward to
going back there one day.
