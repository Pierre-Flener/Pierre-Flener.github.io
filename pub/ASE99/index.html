Schemas encode (human) programming methodologies, such as divide-and-conquer
or constrain-and-generate, and are thus useful for guiding program development,
as demonstrated by powerful, highly automated programming environments,
such as KIDS, DesignWare, and PlanWare.

<P>In this tutorial, we first briefly survey current research on program
generation, so as to argue why schema-guided programming can overcome the
drawbacks of the more traditional approaches, such as proofs-as-programs
or transformation. Then we introduce the notion of specification framework,
as a possibly parametric formalisation of a problem domain, which serves
as background during all development steps. This allows us to give a semantic
definition of schemas, while covering their representation, correctness,
and reusability. Finally, we show how all this can be put to useful practice,
by actively guiding the generation of correct and reusable programs through
the (re)use of schemas. We address automation issues, compare with related
work, and outline future work.
