<FONT COLOR="#CC33CC">Content and Size of Papers</FONT></H3>
At this point, extended abstracts of at most 8 (eight) pages -- including
everything -- are solicited about, but not limited to, the following topics:
<BR>&nbsp;
<CENTER><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 WIDTH="95%" NOSAVE >

</TABLE></CENTER>


<P>Every submission must clearly exhibit the relationship to the (new)
scope of the workshop, and must really be an extended abstract. Read <A HREF="ftp://parcftp.xerox.com/pub/popl96/pugh/advice.ps.Z">Advice
to Authors of Extended Abstracts</A> (from <A HREF="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mleone/how-to.html">Advice
on Research and Writing</A>) if you are uncertain about what constitutes
an extended abstract. Briefly: it must be a miniature research paper with
the key motivations and ideas, with outlines of the proofs of the key theorems,
with references and a (favourable) comparison to related work, but without
full details of proofs or implemented systems, without the description
of future work, without ramifications that are irrelevant to the key ideas.
A good extended abstract convinces a specialist referee of the significance
of the described research in about one hour.

<P>Papers should be typeset in no less than 11 point fontsize, and should
feature at least 2.5cm (1 inch) margins along all edges.

<P>Submissions that fail to comply with these content and size requirements
may be rejected (without refereeing), no matter how high the scientific
merit of the discussed work.

<FONT COLOR="#CC33CC">Submission Deadline</FONT></H3>
<FONT COLOR="#000000">No matter which way you submit (see below), the deadline
is Friday 27 March 1998.</FONT>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#000000">Authors will be notified of acceptance or rejection
by Friday 1 May 1998.</FONT>
<H3>
<FONT COLOR="#CC33CC">Electronic Submission</FONT></H3>
Electronic submissions are strongly encouraged, and must be sent -- preferably
as one email message, MIME attachments being also strongly encouraged --
to <TT><A HREF="mailto:lopstr98@cs.bilkent.edu.tr">lopstr98@cs.bilkent.edu.tr</A></TT>.&nbsp;
The message should contain:
<UL>
<LI>
the title, author information, and abstract in ASCII;</LI>

<LI>
the name and email address of the contact author;</LI>

<LI>
up to 3 keywords, by decreasing relevance, from the list of topics above;</LI>

<LI>
the whole paper in uncompressed, portable Postscript, which must be
interpretable by Ghostscript and which must either use the standard
fonts or include the necessary fonts.</LI>
</UL>
Before submitting electronically, please ensure that your submission complies
with these requirements, as this will save the programme committee a lot
of needless hassle.&nbsp; Read the <A HREF="http://www.computer.org/author/psguide.htm">Guidelines
for Generating and Submitting Portable Postscript Files</A> (from IEEE)
if you want to find out more about how to achieve this (ignore the bit
about using letter paper size).
<H3>
<FONT COLOR="#CC33CC">Hardcopy Submission</FONT></H3>
Authors who cannot meet these requirements should submit 5 (five) hardcopies,
with indication of the keywords, by post or courier service to:

<P>Notice that even airmail may take up to 10 days to reach me from "Western"
countries (yes...), so the usage of a courier service is strongly recommended
should you be near the deadline and should electronic submission be impossible.
