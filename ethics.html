<center><h1>Pierre Flener's Summary of the Ethics Rules at Uppsala University</h1></center>
<hr />
<p>Either of the following four actions is considered cheating:</p>
<ul>
<li>Knowingly using some fellow student's solution, without acknowledging it.</li>
<li>Knowingly submitting a possibly changed version of some fellow student's solution, without acknowledging it.</li>
<li>Knowingly submitting a solution based on a hardcopy or internet publication, without citing it.</li>
<li>Knowingly helping other students potentially to do any of the three actions above. This includes using a <b><em>public</em></b> repository (such as github) for code management within your team.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cheating here means trying to mislead a teacher in the grading of an activity that bears credit points. If no deception is involved in using another solution, it is not considered cheating but there may be significant deductions of points when grading.</p>
<p>All the students, whether active or passive, involved in a suspected cheating case will be referred to the study director. This can lead to a referral to the Disciplinary Committee of Uppsala University. A conviction there can lead to the exclusion from all teaching, examination, and university facilities for up to six months. The head teacher will wait for the verdict of that committee before deciding whether to declare a solution invalid or have it graded, and this decision is independent of that verdict.</p>
<p>It is acceptable to discuss solutions and solution methods with others, but one must have constructed oneself (or within a team, where permitted) the submitted solution. If you think there is a risk that such a discussion leads to very similar solutions, then report this to the head teacher in advance.</p>
<p>Automated solution comparison tools may be used to detect suspected
cheating cases. These tools are very powerful!</p>
