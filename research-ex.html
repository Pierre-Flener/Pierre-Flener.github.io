<p>In a former life, my interest in high-level abstractions for
programming addressed something else than constraint problems.  Here

<h2>Connecting Theory with Practice</h2>

I have some strong opinions on the research areas where I am active,
arguing why certain research avenues should not be explored, listing
directions for future research, debunking existing prejudice of
detractors, etc, all this with the purpose of achieving a stronger
connection between theory and practice:
<ul>
<li>With <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4HOzwp0AAAAJ">Baudouin Le Charlier</a> (Université Catholique de Louvain, Belgium), I explored
the role of the so-called Formal Methods in Computer Science.  In a
first paper [LCF98], we exposed the nonsense behind the concept of
"formal specification".</li>
<li>We applied these insights in order to argue for the desirable link
between theory and practice in the field of abstract interpretation
[LCF97].</li>
<li>With <a href="http://emps.exeter.ac.uk/computer-science/staff/dpartrid">Derek Partridge</a> (University of Exeter, UK), I argued for the necessity
of an <em>inductive programming</em> approach in suitable software
engineering projects [FP01].</li>
<li>With <font color="#0000FF">Lubos Popelinsky</font>, I addressed
some prejudice regarding the inductive synthesis of (recursive)
programs (see below) [FP94].</li>
<li>With <font color="#0000FF">Serap Yilmaz</font>, I discussed
current research results and trends in that area [FY99].</li>
</ul>

<h2>Schema-guided Deductive Synthesis of Programs</h2>

<p>With <a href="http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~kung-kiu/">Kung-Kiu Lau</a>
(University of Manchester, UK),
<font color="#0000FF">Mario Ornaghi</font>
(University of Milan, Italy), and
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/julianrichardson">Julian Richardson</a>
(then at Heriot-Watt University, UK),
I investigated the definition, representation, semantics, and applications
of <em>program schemas</em>, and their usage in effectively guiding the
deductive synthesis of (logic) programs, such that they are correct and a
priori correctly reusable [FLO97, FLO98, FLOR99, FLOR00].
Specifications, programs, and schemas are expressed in the first-order
language of a domain theory, which is called a <em>specification
framework</em>.  Significant leverage over traditional synthesis approaches
is achieved by this combination of frameworks and schemas.</p>

<p>With <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/julianrichardson">Julian
Richardson</a>, I proposed a unified view of program schemas and proof
planning methods, so as to encode the former as the latter.  This
allows the reuse of any proof planner, such as Clam, as an
implementation platform for designing an (automated) schema-guided
program synthesis system [FR99].</p>

<h2>Schema-guided Transformation of Programs</h2>

<p>With <a href="http://www.info.ucl.ac.be/~yde">Yves Deville</a>
(Université catholique de Louvain, Belgium), I pursued research on the
use of program schemas [FLO98] in automating (logic) program
transformation [FD96].  The idea was to pre-compile
transformation/optimisation/generalisation techniques at the
schema-level (i.e., transformation technique T transforms schema S1
into equivalent schema S2, if the applicability conditions C on the
place-holders of S1 hold), so that transformation at the program-level
reduces to the application of a substitution (i.e., if program P1 is
known to be an instance of S1 under substitution s, and if s(C) is
valid, then the transformed program P2 according to T is s(S2), and P2
is guaranteed to be equivalent to P1).  Triple &lt;S1,S2,C> is then
called a <em>transformation schema</em> implementing T.</p>

<p>With <font color="#0000FF">Halime Büyükyildiz</font>, I extended
these ideas [BF97, BF98], and she implemented a prototype system,
called <a href="pub/transys.tar.gz">TranSys</a>, for her MSc thesis
[Büy97].</p>

<h2>Schema-guided Inductive / Abductive Synthesis of Recursive Programs</h2>

<p>This research area is nowadays known as
<a href="http://www.inductive-programming.org">inductive programming</a>.</p>

<p>Continuing my early research [Fle95a, FD93ab, Fle93, FD92], I
investigated the synthesis of (logic) programs from potentially
incomplete specification information (such as examples, properties,
integrity constraints, etc).  This obviously necessitates
not-guaranteed-sound reasoning (such as induction or abduction), and I
thus pursued a cross-fertilisation between (Deductive) Logic
Programming (LP), Inductive Logic Programming (ILP), and Abductive
Logic Programming (ALP) [FP94, FPS94].  The focus was on the
synthesis of logic programs for "computational" concepts, that is
concepts that may be computed by means of some looping construct (such
as recursion or iteration).  For example, <em>sort</em>/2 is such a
"computational" concept, whereas <em>elephant</em>/1 is not.  This
clearly distinguished my research from more general Machine Learning
or ILP work, and defined a very relevant niche thereof.  Moreover,
this focus allowed me to take a Programming approach (rather than
"only" an Artificial Intelligence one), taking advantage of algorithm
design knowledge so as to structure the search space according to
program schemas [FLO98] and structure the background knowledge
according to types, domains, etc.  Correctness of the synthesised
programs (that is, soundness and convergence of the synthesiser) was a
central theme.  Together with <font color="#0000FF">Serap
Yilmaz</font>, I discussed current research results and trends in this
area [FY99].</p>

<p>My <a href="pub/dialogs.tar.gz">DIALOGS</a> system
(<em>Dialogue-based Inductive and Abductive LOGic program
Synthesiser</em>) [Fle97] starts from no evidence at all and asks the
specifier for exactly what it needs, and nothing else.  The queries
and answers of the dialogue are kept entirely in terms of the
specifier's (initially unknown) conceptual language, and such that the
specifier <em>must</em> know the answers if s/he is interested at all
in the resulting program.  This is a drastic simplification, though
with no loss of power, of my <a href="pub/synapse.tar.gz">SYNAPSE</a>
system (<em>SYNthesis of Algorithms from PropertieS and Examples</em>)
[Fle95a, FD93ab, Fle93, FD92], which is not interactive.  This
progress was mostly based on my later results, e.g., on <em>predicate
invention</em> [Fle95b].</p>

<p>With <font color="#0000FF">Serap Yilmaz</font>, I extended these
ideas, and she implemented them into a successor system, called <a
href="pub/dialogs2.tar.gz">DIALOGS-II</a>, for her MSc thesis
[Yil97].</p>

<p>With <a href="http://people.sabanciuniv.edu/esraerdem">Esra
Erdem</a>, I proposed the notion of <em>construction modes</em> as a
new declarative bias for ILP [EF00].  We applied this to develop a
powerful and efficient algorithm for inductively inferring the clausal
definition of an undefined operator of a clausal theory [EF99].</p>

<p>With <a
href="https://www.uni-bamberg.de/en/kogsys/team/schmid">Ute
Schmid</a>, I revisited the research area years later and we wrote a
survey [FS08] and three entries [FS16a, FS16b, FS16c] for the
Encyclopedia of Machine Learning and Data Mining.</p>
